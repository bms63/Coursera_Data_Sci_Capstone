Despite its terribly artful and plush staging, "Finding Neverland" never managed to get around the quiet, solitary and anti-dramatic nature of writing. At least it spared us painful scenes of Johnny Depp as Barrie toiling over a manuscript, opting instead for sudden depictions of his fertile imagination, seen as if through his mind's eye. Yet, for all its intelligence, this movie in the end settles for being a high-end tear-jerker. Somehow, I was hoping for more revelation — and even, I admit, a rosebud or two. Instead, Barrie, in Depp's muted portrayal, remains as remote as he likely was in real life.

100. Chris Greenwood, CB, Albion, 6-1, 193. Ran a 4.41 at Michigan's pro day with a staggering 43-inch vertical jump. This Division III player did what a small-program player has to do to get noticed by the NFL -- dominate every down in every way. Was rarely challenged by opposing quarterbacks, yet his team led the conference in interceptions with 15 because he simply changed the way offenses played. He returned one of his two interceptions for a touchdown.

"If someone told me that was going to happen - that our defense was going to blow a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter - I would have slapped them, especially how we were playing and flying around," defensive tackle Henry Melton said. "Just to have it end like that was devastating."
"I have asked the Secret Service for an explanation of how they have failed to find this woman when the news media seems to have no trouble doing so," King said, noting the "extensive interview in which she details information vital to the investigation."
But no one here had been planning a six-day expose on Texas abortion laws. No effective notice was given – and one can only wonder whether this was by design. So, we had no opportunity to seek other opinions, to balance the presentation, to add context or depth. We considered: On a moment's notice, should we remake our week's opinion pages around Trudeau's surprise? It seemed a calculated ideological ambush: Turn over your opinion pages, or else.
Newcomers Jamie McGinn and Steve Downie made general manager Greg Sherman look good. Matt Du-chene would be unlucky to have another season as injury-filled as this one. He figures to bounce back.

Target says they made the choice after evaluating the Kindle's "price and quality." The retailer still sells Barnes and Noble's Nook and has recently expanded displays of Apple products.
I don't think the Buffs can win with in-state talent alone; they still need that influx from other areas. However, year after year, we see kids that the Buffs passed on and are playing elsewhere. They must be doing something right. D.J. Davis played (and played well) for Oregon in the National Championship; I don't recall the Buffs giving him a sniff. Hopefully, Coach Embree can at least change some of it. Ditto for Colorado State and Air Force. I would enjoy watching those rosters filled more with local talent. Think of the followings they could have.
Just months after Martinez's arrest, John Morton, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, instructed his agency to consider a range of factors when exercising prosecutorial discretion. They include whether the immigrant has lived in the United States for years, avoided trouble with the law, avoided previous deportations and has a child who is a U.S. citizen.

"I felt it was a continuation of what I was doing all spring," Lohse said. "If anyone said they weren't aware of what was going on, they're lying. I knew what I was doing. But I wasn't going to let it affect me. I felt I did a great job of shutting everything out - the atmosphere, whatever - and just going out there and pitch."
"Iran has lost a lot by voluntarily accepting the additional protocol for snap visits to nuclear sites before," said Hamid Reza Taraghi of the Islamic Coalition Party, who has close ties to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Questions to ponder while the NFL shifts its attention back to Peyton Manning:
Trout, who hit .220 with five homers in 40 games with the Angels last season, will play plenty of center field in place of the struggling Peter Bourjos (.178, .245 OBP), but he can also play left field and right.
"I hardly think you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here," Obama said at the news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. His voice was taut and his smile thin.

To help relieve your symptoms, antihistamines that can be bought over-the-counter are available in eye drops, nasal sprays and oral medications in pill or liquid form. Decongestants can help relieve a stuffy nose. Your doctor may prescribe higher-dose medications if your symptoms persist. If those remedies don't work, immunotherapy is the next step - allergy shots.
The reason for the peak of the heat this week? Credit what is called an "upper ridge." Think of it as high pressure in the upper part of the atmosphere. It will strengthen over us today, and that should result in drier conditions, keeping that cloud count down and also lowering the dew point slightly from the mugginess Wednesday. Dew point temperatures reflect the amount of moisture in the air, independent of the temperature. Those two elements are combined to come up with the relative humidity, or moisture in relation to the temperature. When the dew point gets above 60 degrees, people start noticing. Start moving into the mid 60s and they really notice. More than 70, and you're talking tropical The dew point in Indianapolis was 65 degrees or higher from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday. Workin' 9-5! What a way for Mother Nature to make a livin'.

"And during that period, you were having hallucinations and hearing voices tell you what to do?" Christman asked.
Skylar went country, of course, with Jason Aldean's "Tattoos on This Town." But here's the thing. She tends to overdo the twang on proper country songs, pulling it back enough on songs that fall outside her comfort zone to seem more like an honest country singer than a theme-park cartoon of a country singer. What I'm getting at is it was fine but I believed her as a country singer more when she was doing Queen.
"It's a dream spot to be in — that situation with CarGo behind you," Giambi said. "It makes a tough decision for people. You're not out of the woods walking me right there. You load the bases for CarGo? He's been so hot. I figured I'd get something to hit."
The bill would create a $30 billion government fund to help community banks increase lending to small businesses, combining it with about $12 billion in tax breaks aimed at small businesses. Democrats say banks should be able to use the lending fund to leverage up to $300 billion in loans to small businesses, helping to loosen tight credit markets.

In his first year in office, Sarkozy's team rammed through changes like a cap on income taxes for the wealthiest, seen by critics as a sop to the uber-rich friends who backed his candidacy and were in his inner circle from his years as mayor of the wealthy Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine.

Questionable Calls: Wilson was a major reach at the 48th overall selection as a safety with suspect range who wasn't much of a ball-hawk at Illinois. Though New England was wise to concentrate on defense, a young receiver that can get down the field vertically would have been a worthwhile investment in either the second or third round.
That was the year of “Yes, we can,” and “We are the change we have been looking for,” not a year in which he’ll have to ask for a second term after nearly four years of his own national stewardship.

That seemed to be suggested by the bidding, which went much higher than the participants expected. Dr. Scott Rifkin, head of a Baltimore-based investor group that stopped bidding at $1.25 million, said the final price was nearly 50 percent higher than he expected. Buerger said last month that he figured Alter would sell for between $400,000 to $600,000.

City schools Superintendent Kelvin Adams has said he supports Slay's efforts on charters as long as they result in quality schools, and not more substandard ones. Even so, the district has fought the mayor's attempt to play a more active role in the charter school movement by lobbying against legislation that would have allowed Slay to sponsor schools. The Legislature so far has agreed, with the House voting against the idea last week.
For those looking to further connect with Mother Nature, Marquis Los Cabos is a sea turtle watch and rescue site.

It all added up to the Blazers' best performance of the series, but it nearly wasn't enough as Dallas got a huge game from reserve Jason Terry (29 points, seven assists), and another steady performance from star Dirk Nowitzki (25 points, nine rebounds). But this time, the heroes from Game 1 and 2 came back to Earth. Jason Kidd had more turnovers than three-pointers, and Peja Stojakovic was a quiet 3 for 7.
But today, none of the candidates seems completely prepared to grapple with what to do next. Some repeat falsehoods as if they were gospel: Los Angeles County's jails are overcrowded (false; they are at about half capacity). California's recidivism rate is 70% (meaningless, without distinguishing between a new criminal offense that should land an offender back behind bars and a technical parole violation, such as failing to report to an agent in time). Realignment puts parolees on our streets unsupervised (a blatant falsehood). State prisoners are being released early under realignment (false). But it's true that if prosecutors, the courts and the sheriff are not careful, they will release people whom they should keep. And it's true that under realignment, more jail inmates (as opposed to prison inmates) may be unsupervised upon release.

For the same reason I don't go to Laclede's Landing or the big bars surrounding Busch Stadium, I couldn't find much to do in Wrigleyville.

A stunning dunk
Levy supporters this week indicated that they would want to extend the extra health levy even if the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the Affordable Care Act this summer. While the act could help provide money for indigent care and lessen the need for city funds, they said, that could take years to sort out. So city money would be needed far beyond 2014, they claimed.

By asserting that the very purpose of faith -- and the "core struggle of human nature" -- is to strive for closer adherence to the "law of love" in our relations with one another, Obama essentially neutralizes religious difference. Whatever one's belief system -- whether religious or secular -- it all boils down to the same crystallized essence: an "irreducible" something, as he puts it, which is simple and universal. It is the common ideal embodied in the Golden Rule.
Then, Dickson dispatches the smart cop and his none-too-swift partner back to high school. Because of a clerical error, Schmidt finds himself in the drama department and Jenko with the chemistry nerds. Given the changes in high school culture, the qualities that made Schmidt an outsider when he was a senior now admit him to the in crowd. Alas for Jenko, meatheadedness is so 2005.

The department continues to work with the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office in the investigation.
Adopting the gubernatorial cycle would eliminate the practice of filling city offices with un-elected officials when city officials choose to run for other offices and win. Adopting the presidential primary cycle would continue the current practice that allows city officials (and state officials) to run for other offices without the risk of losing their current position. Finally, it would align the Baltimore City election cycle with those of all the other counties in the state.
The whole point of becoming self sufficient in energy — as well as importing crude from friendly Canada — is to become indifferent to crude purchased from countries that want to destroy us. Oil prices are set by global demand. If we produced additional crude so that global productive capacity is in excess of demand, world crude prices would fall, and as Mr Corredoira correctly observes, OPEC would be forced to cut production to maintain prices. However, OPEC members are not all equals in terms of production and population. Countries such as Nigeria cannot cut production because they have an immediate need for cash.

In fact, less than 2 percent of black-owned businesses in the state have more than five employees, the data shows. One in 10,000 have more than 500 employees. Part of the reason for this phenomenon is that most new black-owned firms are "nonemployer firms," which means they consist of only one person. Roughly nine in 10 black-owned firms fit this description, both in New Jersey and the rest of the nation. This trend is not new among African-Americans, but such firms multiplied at a much faster pace in the Garden State, which saw a 72 percent jump during the five-year window, compared to 13 percent for the nation, the data shows.

With the rise of blockbuster comic book-based films like "The Avengers," released Friday, Winsett said he has been pleased to see what has long been a subculture become more widely recognized and accepted.

They started back in 2007 when they tried to con residents into thinking the amendment would hand decisions about local growth to "special interests." (That's not true unless you're a special interest. The proposal simply lets citizens vote on developments and growth matters in their own communities.)
Biggest head-scratcher: Gino Gradkowski. In hindsight, it doesn’t appear the Ravens wanted Wisconsin center Peter Konz as much as we all thought that they did. They passed on him twice and didn’t move up to select him later in the second round. Instead, they selected their potential center of the future early in the fourth. The Ravens had Gradkowski, who played center and guard at Delaware, in for a pre-draft visit, but most of Baltimore let out a collective “Who?!?” when his name was called. This looked like a reach at first, but it has been reported that other teams also thought highly of Gradkowski.
The building's many challenges will make it one of a kind and pioneering, but it's fundamentally an urban office building, Bowers said. That means there's a large market of office construction-related industries that could learn from the center and spend money on the Oregon-made expertise that it exhibits.
In a statement of facts submitted to the SEC and the Justice Department, Diamondback said that a former portfolio manager and a former analyst at the hedge fund "routinely violated" the fund's policy on employee contacts with consultants who may have confidential information on companies. The portfolio manager and the analyst traded stocks while they had information they had received as a result of violating the policy, the statement said.
Tents come in all styles, sizes and prices, and you can usually find a model that sleeps four people at one of the big-box stores. But remember, any tent will perform well in good weather. The question is how will it do when a storm hits?
We were naïve to believe the event would generate enough revenues to shoulder these costs, but I am convinced that the extraordinary turnout and enthusiasm of spectators and television viewers makes a subsidy/offset of fees worthwhile. I recognize that Baltimore's coffers are not full and that the city made a significant contribution to fix its roads and in terms of man-hours leading up to the event. However, I would hate to see this investment wasted when most of the event's problems are easily fixable with a realistic approach to the revenues generated.

But the April 18 raid was not the success Peterson had envisioned. He wanted the drone to track the smugglers to a stash house, and perhaps to ranking cartel members. Instead, Border Patrol agents rushed to the riverbank, sirens blaring. They seized half a ton of pot, a 1996 Plymouth Voyager van and a boat. The smugglers escaped and no one was arrested.

You can bake this in one big pouch, but two smaller pouches is easier to handle. Best of all, probably, is to make an individual serving pouch for each person at the table. One of my favorite things about baking in parchment is the moment when the package is opened and all the mingled scents arise in a big puff of steam.
Catholic leaders have also protested a decision by federal officials not to renew a church contract for work with sex-trafficking victims. Church officials would not provide the women birth control or abortion services.

The scholarship was the end of a rollercoaster year for the 5-foot-10 Feagin. She transferred to the Brooklyn school from Ben Davis (Ind.) only to be initially ruled ineligible by CHSAA Brooklyn/Queens because of transfer rules.

The Cardinals have won four of their last five spring games and are 6-5-1 before they travel to Lakeland, Fla., on Saturday to face the Detroit Tigers. Lefthander Jaime Garcia will start.
With all of the horses seemingly healthy -- and you know how quickly that can change -- the focus here will be on the style of the race. Trinniberg, as I wrote in my story on the draw, is the wild card. Having never raced more than seven furlongs, his connections nevertheless feel convinced that their horse will win the race. Does such wild-eyed confidence mean they're prepared to let him dash from the gates and see how far he'll go? Top trainers such as Bob Baffert and Graham Motion deferred when asked yesterday how they thought the race might unfurl, saying that it would be up to the jockeys.
The bond of baseball had come full circle.

Rachel Bonds’ “Anniversary” depicts the uneasy courtship between a kind young man (Jerry Richardson) and a lonely woman (Julie Fitzpatrick) still mourning the death of her lover. It’s a touching piece, but its effectiveness is undercut by a repetitive reciting of the anniversaries of the woman’s loss.
Tensions in the community had been running high before the riot, fueled in part by the case of a Korean grocer who shot to death a black teenager she had accused of trying to steal a bottle of orange juice.

Only four months into 2012, Minaj has already headlined two of the biggest moments in live music, with her Super Bowl gig followed by an outlandish exorcism-themed Grammys set that was the talk of the telecast.

Fueled By Ramen — the New York-based label that has dominated commercial power-pop — practically treats him as an in-house resource. He’s worked on many of the major Fueled By Ramen releases of the past few years, including Fall Out Boy’s “Infinity on High,” “Santi” by the Academy Is …, and Panic! at the Disco’s marvelously baroque “Vices and Virtues.” It is no exaggeration to suggest that radio sounds the way it now does in part because of him.
Google's Street View has received widespread criticism from the start, especially in Europe. Although many note the project's usefulness, such as helping drivers visualize the place they're going before getting behind the wheel or enabling users to virtually visit a place like the Amazon, Google's cameras have also reportedly caught people urinating, picking up prostitutes and walking around naked.

But Apple has only released milestone announcements -- 500 million songs sold on July 18, 2005; one billion by February 23 of this year; 1.5 billion by September 12. In the company's earnings reports, iTunes sales are bunched together in a category called "other music related products and services." Mr. Munster, the Piper Jaffray analyst, assumes that 50% of that revenue is derived from iTunes. (An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the accuracy of that estimate.) By connecting the dots between milestone reports and his quarterly estimates of iTunes sales, and assuming a constant rate of sales in between, Mr. Munster arrives at his estimates for monthly sales.
Continental would not provide details about the other models, however, and a judge said Smisek must clear up a "discrepancy" between his court testimony and the statement released Wednesday.
Yet another answer is that the figures may not be quite so high as they seem. Full employment here means 7 percent are out of work, and some economist estimate it may really be 10 percent, given the number of people who call themselves unemployed in order to collect compensation.

My apologies are profound regarding my unintentional omission of Herb. Another who should also have been mentioned was the recently retired John Gordon. John arrived here over 25 years ago, leaving his broadcast perch within the hallowed walls of Yankee Stadium, where he was the Yankees play-by-play announcer for at least four seasons. John was also among the very best, and I'm happy to say was also a good acquaintance of mine. Bravo to both Herb and John, and boo-hiss to me for having that "senior monent" brain-burp. I hope my apology and mea culpa are accepted, as they're certainly sincere.
That scene unfolded when Ellee Thalheimer of Southeast Portland was researching a four-day bike route around the Wallowas. Stymied by snow in Halfway, she and her friends copped a ride in a monster truck with the miner and his Keystone beers and his guns and his country music. Thalheimer, 33, may be firmly entrenched in Portland's yoga and cycling culture but she keeps an open mind about learning to shoot.

The system relies on companies to make employees aware of coverage and to report deaths and injuries to insurers and the federal government.

The wide-mouthed wood-burning oven at the back means pizza. Yes! It's Neapolitan style, the crust blistered from the searing heat, the supple dough smeared with a terrific tomato sauce. No surprise, that. Conant's salsa di pomodoro is famous and goes onto a $24 plate of spaghetti at Scarpetta. Our pizza margherita is seriously good, with pools of molten bufala mozzarella.

The Irish called whiskey "uisce beatha," which translates to "water of life," and by the 19th century U.S. distillers had cooked up a whiskey niche of their own, with corn-based concoctions making Kentucky's soul as much about bourbon as horses. The combination of grains and distillation methods has evolved over time and fashion, and even the spelling - "whiskey" or "whisky" - might provoke a barstool battle. Now, thanks to craft distillers, the water of life can come in many flavors, proofs, bottles and barrels - and even frozen. Here's a round of sites for experiencing the spirit's true spirit.

The middle-class thing is what's most important. A person could argue that power and wealth are always concentrated among a privileged few. What was it George Orwell said in "Animal Farm" - all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others?
The utility is in the midst of checking for records on its pipelines in and around urban areas. PG&E failed to meet a March 15 state deadline to submit a detailed accounting of all its older pipelines that have not undergone high-pressure water testing, the inspection method best-suited for detecting flawed welds.

The statue was most likely lost at sea after being plundered by Roman soldiers in Greece around the time of Christ. (The government of Greece has never asked that the statue be returned there.)
Nicholas Stoller directs and re-teams with Jason Segel on the script -- the pair worked together on the superior "Forgetting Sarah Marshall." In another Judd Apatow production, they try to mine a similar vein -- call it the profane romantic comedy. But here, the story drags on too long, and it's not as inspired to begin with. Segel stars as Tom, half of the couple who can't seal the deal, and Emily Blunt plays Violet, his fiancée. Segel is a warm-and-fuzzy presence in everything he's in, and Blunt is delightful. Some bits are funny, some vulgar, some sweet.
Tornado sirens sounded across Oklahoma City before dawn, and at least three possible tornadoes were reported west and north of the city, said Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management official Michelann Ooten.

Republican Gov. John Kasich has proposed a state budget that would slash the Consumers' Counsel funding by 51 percent over the next two years and cripple the operations of the agency, whose mission is to represent customers against utility companies.

“If the goal of this legislation is to replace an already broken system for providing affordable housing with a common sense, predictable and achievable process, then this bill sorely misses the mark,” said Christie in a prepared statement. “The Senate has presented a considerably different version of the legislation I originally supported in June."
There is no cap on the number of fees that may be waived in a day or the number of times a customer may overdraw her account and settle up the next day, Walsh said.

Pinfield left “120 Minutes” in 1999; in 2003, it was canceled. The show’s amalgam of offbeat videos, choice classic cuts, clockwork imagery and interview segments was occasionally imitated by other video programs. But no successor to “120 Minutes” ever emerged. It is arguable that YouTube and other free video-sharing sites on the internet are that successor, and that “120 Minutes” is no longer necessary.

That's OK — something similar happened to the tea party movement, and that didn't prevent it from being a force to be reckoned with in the 2010 elections — but it's still hard to escape the feeling that since Occupy activists were kicked out of their encampments across the country this winter, the group has lost a good deal of momentum as well as what little organizational coherence it possessed.
Manning himself was a first overall draft pick and has a Super Bowl victory to his credit, but a second championship — this time as the unquestioned leader — would be one more than his brother and may allow him to finally step out of the shadow Peyton has long cast since his days at Tennessee.

Gorgonzola-Stuffed Dates combine salty, pungent cheese with toasty almonds or walnuts in another do-ahead dessert nibble that can also shine on a cheese display or as an hors d'oeuvre. The Gorgonzola lends salt to the sweet date, while the nut adds crunch; using walnuts instead of almonds gives a hint of tannin, which can help offset tannins when paired with a young vintage port. Ruby port and late harvest Zinfandel are other dessert wine choices for the stuffed dates.

Lohse fed the jam with consecutive walks, the second of which forced in the tying run. With several lefthanded bats available and only righthander Victor Marte warm in the Cardinals bullpen, Roenicke chose to let Estrada hit for himself. Lohse escaped the rally with a strikeout; Marte started the seventh inning after Yadier Molina's two-run home run made a 5-3 game.
Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger). There's also a castaway (Jenny Slate) who one-ups Tom Hanks by conversing with not one but five face-painted balls (tennis, golf, basket-, base- and Nerf foot-).

Today, most health professionals have finally acknowledged that chronic fatigue syndrome is a real and serious illness. But its name, which focuses on just one of the disorder's many symptoms, has served to trivialize the condition, making it seem more psychological than physical and reducing interest in the disease among mainstream medical and scientific researchers.

There are so many exemplars of not giving up and then making it to the top of the talent and non-broke rung. Another is actor-comedian Jim Carrey, who had to live in his car for more than a few weeks before his big break arrived. As chronicled in one of my A SENIOR MOMENT webcasts (www.startribune.com/video) a few weeks ago, even Gregory Peck, one of the greatest actors of all time, often slept on benches in Central Park because he couldn't afford to pay apartment rent during his fledgling acting days in New York. (SIDEBAR MEMORY: I'm honored to state Mr. Peck kindly took me under his wing as a professional and eventually personal friend beginning in 1968. He signed one of my favorite photos with him and me as being my "podner", and taken during the filming of THE STALKING MOON, with Eva Marie Saint and Robert Forster, the latter appearing in what was then his second feature film. He most recently played George Clooney's father-in-law in THE DESCENDANTS.)

Go ahead and call him a ‘coward,' as another tweeter said. Sorry, can't help you, because in that case you're not interested in justice. And as for the idea that one not-guilty verdict taints other positive tests, seriously? When one criminal trial ends with not-guilty, do we empty the jails because every other conviction must be wrong, too? If baseball or any other sport is going to have a drug-testing system, there needs to be a way for a player to appeal a positive test. If there's going to be an appeal process, it needs to be fair enough that if the player makes a legitimate case that the test was flawed, he gets off."
“He had another strain,” general manager Dayton Moore confirmed. “We’re still waiting on the final diagnosis. It’s around the same area, but I’m not sure it’s the same thing.”
Tressel<U+0092>s 10-year reign as coach of the Buckeyes ended in disgrace as he was forced to step down for breaking NCAA rules. He knew players received cash and tattoos for autographs, championship rings and equipment and did not tell anyone at Ohio State nor the NCAA what he knew for more than nine months. NCAA rules <U+0097> and Tressel<U+0092>s contract <U+0097> specify that he must disclose any and all information about possible violations.
Should teachers have the freedom to lead private lives we may not all agree with? And should they be able to post controversial tidbits on social networking sites? Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, believes that they should. He took his argument to our Opinion pages Monday in “Teachers under the morality microscope,” writing that teachers shouldn’t be disciplined or fired for activities they pursue outside of work so long as those activities are lawful.

DeMott entered prison in May 2007, sentenced to 23-60 months on four counts of attempted armed robbery, with credit for time served. It was a ridiculous sentence for a 15-year-old, as even then-MDOC health services administrator Lynda Zeller suggested: "It is unfortunate that Mr. DeMott was directed into prison at 15 years old rather than being retained in the juvenile justice system where more age-appropriate resources exist," Zeller wrote in an Oct. 20, 2008, confidential memo.

But it wasn't just "Hulkamania" that got me hooked on wrestling; I couldn't learn enough about every single superstar that graced the ring.

"Ninety-five percent of international relations is symbolic, and state visits are important," said Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter American Dialogue think tank, at a March 12 conference on Brazil-U.S. Relations at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. "The fact is that Brazil wanted this to be a state visit, and that they felt a bit insulted."

Andrew Luck, Stanford, 6-4, 234: Luck is a complete prospect with experience, a history of production, a feel for the game, size, athleticism, top intangibles and toughness. He doesn't have an arm like John Elway's, but it's good enough — similar to Manning's, and he throws as accurately. His movement skills are similar to Jay Cutler's and he can throw on the run. He can take a hit like Cutler. Luck has shown he can work through his progressions and find second and third options. He has produced for four years and is considered NFL-ready. There is very little chance Luck will be a bust, and an excellent chance he will be a Pro Bowl caliber player.
Spotlight on Juan Pablo Angel: The Colombian striker joined MLS as a designated player with the New York Red Bulls in 2007 and spent four seasons there, scoring 62 goals. Last season he went to the Los Angeles Galaxy (after New York signed Thierry Henry), but the Galaxy traded him to Chivas in August to make room for Robbie Keane. Angel, 36, scored seven goals in nine matches last season for Chivas but has missed five games this season with concussion symptoms. He returned to action last week, coming off the bench for 27 minutes.

Sitcom's locally designed furniture collections will seem familiar to anyone who's spent time shopping for modern furniture styles. Furniture and accessories sold at the outlet are often marked as one-of-a-kind floor models, or they may be discontinued collections or pieces. Cabinetry, tables, media centers and bookcases are often sold in boxes for assembly. At its upcoming sale, overstock, discontinued and slightly damaged designer furniture and accessories will be marked down further. In the same warehouse, Hebi Arts, wholesaler of innovative, contemporary home accessories will be selling discontinued and sample inventory at 50 to 70 percent markdowns from retail.

Since Sugg began braving the chilly winters of Northern Ohio, his winnings have skyrocketed and his five kids can stay put all year. He has won 1,347 races since 2006, and a best of 335 races in 2010. Sugg had 293 victories in 2011, with 74 wins this year.
Such issues motivate his novels — "Little" (1995), "The Hiawatha" (1999) and "The Translation of Dr. Apelles" (2006) — which, shifting between past and present, the reservation and the city, play with our preconceptions of Indian culture, what he dismisses as "trauma porn." But with "Rez Life," Treuer likens the process more to that of writing his grandfather's eulogy, which required looking below the surface for a message, to find meaning in an inexplicable event.

Developers in the Mojave Desert last month were so keen on going forward with their project that they didn't consult with Native Americans about the ancient objects that might lie underground or conduct the required archaeological work in a thorough way. This has happened before: It happened most recently in downtown Los Angeles last year at the site of one of the area's oldest burial grounds. Now it's happening again 200 miles east, in the desert.

Should be like 10-14 points, right? Well, it is a dogfight; Why? Because the Rockets have hit five 3-pointers and the Cavs have hit one and it came in the last second of the half. Also, Houston had 15 made free throws and the Cavs have just six. The fouls are even. What you have here is why the Rockets are so scrappy. They find ways to win.

The move is a dramatic reversal for Amazon, which has fought hard across the country against being forced to collect state sales taxes.

When a steak house cuts back on bells and whistles, you get, well, a steak house. That's not to say that things aren't good at Bourbon Steak, because many items are still excellent, but the restaurant has scaled back its ambitions in both food and service.
* Employees and directors don't have to be law-abiding Oregon citizens.

When Obama does cover those fine arms, the past 100 days have been a veritable ode to the cardigan.

With her impressive height, she can wear them easily.

Marijuana is indelibly associated with food, whether it is chemotherapy patients using the drug to try to develop an appetite, or, farcically, a couple of stoners with an overpowering case of the munchies in "Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle." Secret "herb dinners" with appetizers, entrees and desserts are reported in newspaper food sections. One restaurant chain, CHeBA HUT, is based on a marijuana theme. And patrons of the World Famous Cannabis Cafe in Portland can get a burger or lasagna packing a pot punch in between choruses of karaoke.

Nobody really wants this, but the Republicans in Washington seem to think they do. But why now when the debt ceiling has been raised seven times in the past decade under George W. Bush without anyone batting an eye? Where was the scrutiny and the concern when the previous president decided to wage two wars while at the same time cutting revenues by allowing tax breaks and loopholes favoring the very wealthy and "too big to fail" corporations, which have reaped enormous profits at the expense of our citizens and the environment? Where was the outrage when the housing market was ballooning to an obvious breaking point and average citizens began to see their wages stagnate or slip?

A Port Authority document titled "NY/NJ Executive Referrals," released by the agency during a wrongful termination suit, lists 39 hires that had been referred to the agency under Christie during his first year in office alone. That’s more than a third of the 110 referrals from all of New Jersey’s governors since 1998.

“25 to 30 percent of kids in America are overweight or obese,” said Phil Wu, a doctor with Kaiser Permanente, which is sponsoring the film's promotion. To Wu, promoting healthy food is preemptive care. “It’s more efficient to prevent obesity than to treat it once it’s there. The more fresh fruits and vegetables you eat, the better. The less sugar-sweetened beverages you drink, the better. The more low fat milk, the better.”

A: Thanks for the tutorial and, no, you're not the first to bring this to my attention -- and you're not the first to completely misinterpret the lyric and miss the metaphor. Believe me, I've consumed enough alcoholic beverages in my time to know how they are made and what the proper nomenclature is. But that line in the song has little or nothing to do with alcoholic beverages. It's a sociopolitical statement. My only regret would be having to explain it in detail to you, which would defeat the purpose of using literary devices in songwriting and lower the discussion to some silly and irrelevant argument about chemical processes.

That's the suggestion from officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, following earlier studies of theirs that made the same point.

Covered in pale shades of reflective glass, the CityCenter is an imposing surprise (yes, even Vegas has surprises) in a stretch of neon-lit faux-European structures. It must have looked dynamic to architects on a miniature scale, but in real life, it's difficult for visitors on the ground to distinguish which buildings are which and whether any of them even want you to come inside.

Paisley is, as every fan of country music knows, an astonishingly expressive guitarist, able to squeeze passages of novelty and beauty out of his instrument. The same might be said of Sierra Hull, a prodigious mandolin player who is barely out of her teens and currently on a scholarship at Berklee. The Nashville establishment doesn't have much time for bluegrass or newgrass, and in this case (and many others) it's Music City's loss: Hull has the charisma of a star and the interpretive skill of a 30-year veteran. On "Best Buy," a standout from "Daybreak," she even tries her hand at a little Western swing; like everything else she tries, it's a winner. And when she fires up the band for an instrumental, as she does on "Bombshell," the results are jaw-dropping.

These are, in various subtle ways, recognizably images by a generation of artists who came of age during the first decade of the Castro regime. Modernist in feeling, many are also magical realist in tone, with strongly poetic readings of Cuban-based themes. But, as in such novels as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude," the poetry tends to be inflected with ironic, bone-deep political and social skepticism.

Ken Williams has the enviable position of seemingly being the only Chicago executive immune from the pressure to win and perform. In recent years we have seen all the Chicago franchises clean house. The Chairman needs to pocket his loyalty and let Williams go and bring in a new philosophy. I don't mean elevating Rick Hahn, either. There is a reason Hahn is still with the Sox. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing how wonderful is everyone in the Sox's organization. The chamber of commerce pitch delivered by those such as Hawk Harrelson and Steve Stone and others is insulting to knowledgeable fans. How many more years do Sox fans have to tolerate more of the same? How many more years does Williams get? -- Mike Major; Granger, Ind.

The latest affront comes courtesy of the burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers on a military base near Kabul. Military officials maintain the Qurans were being used by imprisoned jihadists to pass messages to other prisoners and were confiscated and destroyed. A spokesman for the NATO-led force said the troops, "... should have known to check with cultural advisers to determine how to dispose of religious material properly." For this unintended action, however, Mr. Karzai wants the soldiers to be put on trial and has asked NATO commanders to allow it. If they do, they will have disgraced their uniform.

Like "The Lord of the Rings," C.S. Lewis' "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was the product of a Great Britain that had just been through a war of survival. The story neither was about World War II, nor was it an allegory for it, and yet it was informed by the moral absolutes and challenges of the wartime period: There's the presence of darkest evil, which can't be avoided but must be faced head-on. There's the grim understanding that sacrifice is necessary, that whole worlds are riding on the actions of a handful of individuals. And, in the presence of a wickedness so complete as to be supernatural, there's faith in absolute goodness.

As Liz looks back on these years from adulthood, retaining the wary, no-nonsense voice of her teenage self, she is on a quest for a mentor, all the while sublimating that need by being a responsible and concerned older sister and cousin. Mostly, the adult women around Liz just teach her painful lessons about men. Watching these women driven crazy by a man's absence, or turning a blind eye to a man's destructive habits, teenage Liz wonders "if loving someone means you are never happy unless they're around and sometimes not even then."

Soon Childers is neglecting Lynn and their daughter, Paige (Madeline Carroll), pouring every resource he has, financial and otherwise, into his work in Africa. Events cause him to wonder himself if he is indeed doing the right thing -- but his temper always overrides his misgivings.

Last year, Shackleford finished fourth in the Derby, then defeated Animal Kingdom by a half-length to win the Preakness.
A 40-something woman who works out three days a week doesn't need 100 grams of protein a day. That's closer to what an athlete needs. ("Athlete" means someone who exercises more than an hour at a time, multiple days of the week. Time, not trophies, matter here.) Here's how to calculate your clients' needs and your own -- we assume you, like them, are fairly active. Bump up the basic protein requirement to 0.5 grams per pound. For a 150-pound person, that's 75 grams of protein a day.
The school itself proposed two years of probation starting in a period that would end in January of 2014, but the NCAA clearly thought it was inadequate, and doubled the sanction.

Yet this 22,000-square-foot showpiece doesn't have a restaurant, not even if it was dreamed up by architect Howard Backen, who created not only the Meadowood resort but restaurants like Press, or if its interior designer was Orlando Diaz-Azcuy, known for his work at Masa's.
If there are two weaknesses to Felton, it is his size – the Blazers posted him relentlessly in a November matchup in New York – and his shooting. He is a career 41.2 percent shooter (Miller was 45.9 percent career shooter), which includes a career mark of 33.3 percent from three-point range. He does, however, pose at least a threat from the outside, making a career-high 116 three's last season, which will help the Blazers' spacing.
Over the past 10 years, increased standardized testing and harsher penalties for a growing number of schools have led to frustration and public resentment about federal public education policy. Hence we are cheered by the U.S. Department of Education's recent decision to offer more flexible and reasonable options for demonstrating progress on improving student achievement. Instead of reducing accountability for student achievement, we believe the waiver will help Oregon increase accountability.

Payne is an assistant with Kentucky now, incidentally. No shocker there. Ask about it his relationship with Calipari, and Wesley calls it a "friendship." Probably worth a deeper look by the NCAA, although, Wesley is no Willie Lyles. He's too sophisticated and has been doing his job for too long.
Opposition to both projects - one on the riverfront in Spanish Lake in St. Louis County and the other in St. Louis City just south of the Chain of Rocks - came under fire from local environmental groups and area residents who argued that, with six casinos open, the St. Louis region has enough already.

It is not a student's fault if he or she is being shuttled from one parent or grandparent to another, has no time or place to do homework or is never encouraged to read. But it is not the teacher's fault either. The very best teacher who can jump through hoops while tap dancing through a lesson will never inspire a child whose home does not value education.

Madonna has a new movie in theaters and an album coming out next month.

Yet many who aspire to build the next Facebook are learning from the mistakes of their guru, Mark Zuckerberg. His company was unprepared for the battle that erupted when Yahoo sued in March for infringing 10 patents.

Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Oracle and other tech giants are locked in patent lawsuits.

The wines range from light to medium body, contain racy acidity and minerality, and have flavors of citrus, apple, white pepper and spice. Grüner is sometimes described as having the floral perfume of a German Riesling and the refreshing zip of a Loire Sauvignon Blanc. This wine should be consumed young.

Overall, U.S. light-vehicle sales averaged an annual rate of 14.6 million in the first quarter. At that pace, U.S. auto sales would finish 2012 with their highest total since 2007. At the beginning of 2012, many best-case scenarios had called for 14 million in sales this year. GM is expecting sales to top that level, Johnson said. Ford said it plans to update its sales forecast Wednesday, which currently calls for 13.3 million to 14.3 million light-vehicle sales.

The incident appears similar to other unprovoked attacks in St. Louis and across the country frequently spearheaded by teens. In a similar attack in April near Grand Boulevard and Chippewa Street, Hoang Nguyen, 72, and his wife, Yen, were walking from a Vietnamese market near their home when two males and two females approached, police said. Nguyen was punched in the head and kicked in the abdomen. He died at a hospital. His wife suffered an eye socket fracture after she was punched in the face.
That's why it was both amusing and unsettling when Bryant made his first field goal with 7:30 left in the fourth quarter to cut the Hornets' lead to 75-67. Bryant caught a pass from Pau Gasol from the left elbow, nailed a 17-foot jumper and prompted everyone at Staples Center to go berserk as if the Black Mamba had never made a shot in his life. Converting a contested layup that reduced the Hornets' lead to 77-69 with 6:24 left created a similar reaction, while Bryant pumped his fist with delight. And there was sure a sense of irony when "M-V-P" chants reigned over Staples Center as he hit one of two free throws to slice the gap to 79-76 with 4:24 left.

The beauty of HbA1C lies in its ability to tell you how well or badly controlled your blood sugar was in the previous two to three months. It indicates the average value of your sugar in that period. The advantage of this is a clearer picture of whether medicine, diet and activity are keeping your sugar in a safe range. A single measurement of sugar can be misleading. It provides information on only a very short time span. It doesn't provide the big picture that HbA1C does.

Regarding the plans to tax area residents for the sewer clean water plan, I'll point out that the city (just the city) has 66 square miles of area. A one inch rain covering that square area works out to 1.15 billion gallons of rain water, or 3531 acre feet if I'm doing my math right, and I think I am. That's the equivalent of a 40 acre lake, 88 feet deep. An acre is about 90% the area of a football field, not including the end zones. Of course the city is not entirely non-permeable surface, but I bet its at least 75% that way. And what if we get 2 or 3 inch rain? We sometimes do, don't we? And, by the way, while St. Louis county might be a lot more permeable, is 508 square miles, not including areas that are already water. So as a non-Civil Engineer, I have a few simple questions: How is MSD planning to collect, pump, store, and treat all this water? How long does it take to treat water from a 1 inch rain, and what happens if you get a 2 inch rain before you have the previous rainfall treated? Or is this something like Social Security, where I should just trust the government and am better off not asking about the details or where my money is going?

• Landing lineman Arik Armstead is a big sign of the times for Oregon football -- Rob Moseley, Eugene Register-Guard: “Simply stated, this is a huge pickup for Oregon,” analyst Greg Biggins wrote for ESPN.com. “Recruiting elite defensive linemen has been the one area the Ducks have struggled in over the last few years, and in landing Armstead they’re getting a player who can make an early impact.” Helping Armstead in his bid for early playing time will be his intention to enroll at the university in time for spring practices in April.

If you've never sat in the boxes before - don't waste your time. We sat in the box for the first half but felt very isolated. The Timbers, if I remember correctly, had a significant lead at the half and the Timbers Army was hopping. We moved down close at halftime, probably section 109 or so.

But there is plenty of music in Marley, including exquisite alternative takes of early, essential songs. What also comes across is how, while life in the Marley camp was chaotic and ganja-fogged, he held to his core beliefs. His songs espoused freedom, love, and equality, and so, too, did his actions. Marley became a wealthy man in the last years of his life, but he gave much of his money away - people would queue up at the gates of his Kingston compound, and they would leave with cash.

And it's not just commerce. Once our friends and family knew our phone number and called us on our home phones -- but people who were neither could look us up and do the same. Now we increasingly carry cellphones instead of using landlines, and we don't want our new numbers listed. We don't see the need, because even though we have phones all the time, we're also reachable via text messages and email and social-networking sites -- and in many situations we're coming to prefer those communications methods to the insistent, one-size-fits-some summons of a ringing phone. Sometimes we don't need to communicate directly at all -- we drop by our friends' Web pages, Facebook profiles or MySpace outposts to get the latest, and update ours so they can do the same.

Brazilian-born Isa Brito, 47, came by her line of garden fresh herbals somewhat by chance. A former photojournalist, she was in her 20s when she began creating simple body and makeup products for her daughter. The products spread to her daughter's school friends and then to their mothers.

Its hull dates to 1907, when it was built for a railroad ferry at Vicksburg, Miss. Streckfus Steamers of St. Louis bought the boat, lengthened its hull to 375 feet and lavished it with a sleek, million-dollar Art Deco steel skin. Reborn as the S.S. Admiral, the boat's first cruise from the St. Louis levee was on June 12, 1940.

Following a hard workout and declaring himself pain free, Nagbe said playing the full 90 minutes in the exhibition game at Oregon State is the next step in his rehabilitation.
But the key here isn't in any conventional element, it's in the sustained air of sketch-comedy absurdism, the comically overdone gestures, the random bursts of joyfully naive dance and song (although the Katie Griesar score doesn't stand out here as much as usual), and little curlicues of language and logic. When Cinder first decides she needs a cleaner, she picks up the phone and say, "Can I have the number for the Yellow Pages?" Later on, Ink Blot (played with customary verve by Mouawad), confesses, "My father, he beat me with a calendar on the 31st of every month." (Prompting the quizzical response, "So, not every month?")
United-Continental Airlines started a program that lets frequent fliers exchange a gift card from one of 60 major retailers for frequent flier miles. Similarly, U.S. Bank's FlexPerks Travel Visa Signature card holders can exchange select gift cards for credit card rewards points.

That didn't happen, but New Age philosophy took hold, adding another facet to Arizona's tourism industry.
There are obvious reasons to criticize the Dolans and the Indians: drafting, talent evaluation, drafting, player development in some cases and -- most of all -- drafting. Beating the owners-are-too-cheap drum is an oversimplification in a sport without a salary cap and in a city struggling in a tough economy.

The quake's effects on their families and all San Franciscans reverberated for months after the 508-city-block fire was finally halted at Van Ness Avenue. When Martin returned home, hundreds of the 235,000 newly homeless were camped on their hillside. Night and day, the displaced watched the conflagration below, transfixed by the spectacle. Rose's mother took in two pregnant women, midwifed several births and shared the family's well water. Rose's youngest sister, Josephine, delivered milk from the family cow to Tent City mothers with babies. Josephine, who was 11, recorded her memories of the quake decades later:
“Afghanistan? Whose bright idea was that?” the Russian asks Warnock. “Nothing but dust and earth . . . it is like your Texas. Why would you want another Texas? Ah! I have a proposition. We give you Afghanistan, you give us Texas.”
Joseph says that while the team is motivated by all the talk about the Pac-12 being down this year, the Ducks’ seniors are motivated more by something else: This is their last shot at the NCAA tournament. It’s win or go home for the Ducks (21-8, 12-5), who don’t have a strong enough out-of-conference schedule to ensure an at-large bid.

"The King's Speech" is the kind of production that makes you ask: why can't every film be made this way? Rich characters fully drawn. Sterling performances. Superb writing, production design, no wasted scenes. Director Tom Hooper has made a breathtaking masterpiece. Even if you're burned out on monarchy movies and imports from Britain, treat yourself to a few hours with Firth and company in this funny, touching, based-on-a-true-story tale, which finally opens in Cleveland on Saturday.
DUBLIN -- Letting your telephone ring in a courtroom is rarely a good idea. Taking the call is worse.
"It is very disappointed after all of the work Bob has done and all the sacrifices he has made for his love of his country, family and friends," Karilyn Bales wrote early last year on the blog, which could not be independently verified. "I am sad and disappointed too, but I am also relieved, we can finally move on to the next phase of our lives."
The plan offers a "way out of a dysfunctional system," said Rep. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, co-chair of the committee. "It is frustrating to see the different processes not working in alignment. It just leads to inertia. We need to find a way out."
Shares of the nation's No. 2 natural gas producer tumbled nearly 13 percent Wednesday. Chesapeake reported disappointing earnings and a media report raised a new potential conflict of interest involving its CEO.

After waiting two hours, today's hearing was canceled with little explanation.

The world’s second-ranked player, McIlroy’s presence looms large.
Increases in salaries and benefits added $1.7 million in expenditures, Orr said. Of this, $300,000 comes from sick leave reimbursement. When employees retire they can choose to receive accumulated sick leave pay as a lump sum at the end of their final year, or they can spread the payments throughout the year. If they choose a lump sum, the payment would come out of the district's 2012-13 budget. But an increased number have chosen to spread out the payments this year, increasing the district's 2011-12 expenses, Orr said.
surfaces with official confirmation, it's going to be with an announcement that Kelly is NFL-bound, and the Ducks are without a head coach. So what? That's right. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried. Because I believe Oregon, not Kelly, is the bonafide key to success in Eugene.
Point guard signed: The Cavaliers signed point guard Ben Uzoh to a 10-day contract as an insurance policy in Irving's absence. He played 42 games last season for the New Jersey Nets, averaging 3.8 points and 1.6 assists.

After applying for about 100 jobs, the environmental science major even offered "one week of free labor'' last summer to get a foot in the door at the landscaping company. But that job ended with the season, as will the one she's in now. Her dream of becoming a park ranger or environmental educator is drifting away.
Even as several hundred Stanford fans celebrated the football team's biggest victory in decades, the welcome-home scene Tuesday had a surreal feel because of the uncertainly over the futures of coach Jim Harbaugh and quarterback Andrew Luck.
The separation rate includes voluntary quits, layoffs and retirements. The quitting rate often serves as a good barometer of a worker's willingness or ability to change jobs.

Aerified last week: Bartley Cavanaugh, Bass Lake, Indian Creek, Turkey Creek
A condition in which the sutures close too early, called craniosynostosis, has been associated with early fontanelle closure. Craniosynostosis results in an abnormal head shape and problems with normal brain and skull growth. Premature closure of the sutures may also cause the pressure inside of the head to increase. The condition can be diagnosed by physical exam, but often X-rays or a CT scan is required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other abnormalities.
"They had a huge shortage of priests in the early states. There certainly weren't enough people to go around," Doyle explained. "What happened is that all of the (religious) communities really adapted and adjusted to the situation in which they found themselves. They simply met the unmet needs of that particular day."
Chaison added that he doesn't expect any big changes in contracts with those two automakers this year. The union is likely to wait until 2015 when the economy has, it's hoped, improved and when it will have the ability to strike to make bigger changes.
Start your outing by the U.N. Plaza entrance to the Civic Center BART Station. Once part of Fulton Street, U.N. Plaza today is a red brick promenade honoring the United Nations, which was founded just three blocks away in the Veterans Auditorium in 1945. In front of Lawrence Halprin's fountain on Market is the plaza's latest art work, "Dandelion" by Karen Cusolito. This is part of the ARTery Project, an initiative to beautify the central Market Street corridor.

• Thunder 111, Blazers 107 -- Darnell Mayberry, Oklahoman: This was a great win. By far the best of the season. It wasn’t always pretty. But when you’re the best (by record), you’re going to get everyone’s best, and it’s going to sometimes be hard-nosed, physical contest. That’s what this was. And the fact that the Thunder came into the Rose Garden, where the Blazers had only lost once in 12 games, and slayed a team that was whupping opponents by an average of 18.3 points in their building, speaks volumes.

The man is accused of bilking Ohio donors out of $2 million from 2005 to 2010, and an estimated $100 million nationwide. He was represented by defense attorney Mark Stanton, who told the judge Thompson should be granted bail because the accused has no criminal record, is charged with nonviolent offenses and is "essentially penniless."
When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate. Japan's confusion and frustration gave the Americans wide-open spaces in front of the goal, and they easily could have been up 4-0 at halftime.

Few candidates have more experience: Brown's 40 years in and out of state politics include two terms as governor and two terms as mayor of Oakland.

The jury — which is made up of five black women, two black men, three white women and two white men — spent about two hours deliberating Monday. They are to resume their discussions Tuesday. Schurick could receive up to five years of prison time on each of the election fraud charges if convicted. Henson is scheduled to be tried next month.
Civil service also sets up often cumbersome rules to fire current employees, Keefe said. The tool kit proposals would also consolidate the disciplinary process, considering both minor and major infractions in the same forum.
The Jaguars safety made an end-zone hit to prevent a catch by Edwards that could have put the Jets up by three points with 5:07 to go and conceivably made Josh Scobee's field goal, which turned out to be the game winner, only a game-tying kick.

Casino gambling was promoted in 1992 for the historic mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek, with proceeds promised to historic preservation there and across the state. Since 1993, State Historical Fund competitive grants totaling $247 million have gone to 3,379 projects statewide, giving many towns a new life. Half went to government entities — towns, counties and the state. The Governor's Mansion received $709,591 over the past 11 years. More than $30 million went to the state Capitol. The legislature has decreed that approximately $17 million from the SHF will go to repair the Capitol dome. The Colorado Historical Society, administrator of the Historical Fund, gets $5 million a year until 2045, totaling $185 million, for its gorgeous new History Colorado Center, which opens in April. You don't have to be a purist to think that's not truly historic preservation.

And you know what? Compromise has no place in the kitchen. At the French-influenced Rat’s, which is part of the Grounds for Sculpture, Sbraga’s high standards and wide-ranging palette are evident on the French-influenced menu: The Griggstown quail is accompanied by an apple-beet purée, seared foie gras and Jordan almonds. The butter-braised lobster tail comes in a spiced saffron emulsion, and even the cheeseburger is coddled with sottocenere, a truffle-laced cow’s milk cheese from northern Italy.
In the haze of shock, grief and recrimination that followed the destruction of Minoru Yamasaki's twin towers, rebuilding at the site, which quickly became known as ground zero, became one mantra America convinced itself we could rally around. But the process ground slowly toward gridlock: Daniel Libeskind wound up winning a high-profile master-plan competition for the site, then saw his proposal slowly gutted while he turned to designing condo towers for Sacramento and Covington, Ky. The memorial to the World Trade Center's 2,700 victims, by Michael Arad and Peter Walker, was also delayed and diluted; it is scheduled to open, at least in part, by 2011.

Doesn't matter which side you're on, you need the facts to argue your point.
"As years go by, we as police officers become hardened and cynical; we sometimes lose focus on the true purpose and reason for our mission," Isom said. "We begin to think in terms of us versus them, and what they owe us for service. But David will always be in that special place where we all started. He had it right. It's we, not them. It's what we owe them, not what they owe us."
But even beyond the explicit nature of the permanent exhibition, the site tour brought the cold and calculated terror into a physical reality. At 15 stations around exposed building remnants, placards provide details of the site's use during the Nazi period and show the exact spots where, over a 12-year period, 12,000 prisoners were interrogated and tortured before being sent to concentration or labor camps. The site also integrates the longest remaining continuous piece of the Berlin Wall, which has been designated a historical monument.
Reports also suggest that babies do not receive as much interaction from tech-addicted parents, potentially changing the way babies acquire language skills. Is there a measurable impact when children are raised by parents who keep one eye on a screen and the other on the household? The constant connectivity that has become such an accepted part of our lives has changed our very brain structure, along with the social and psychological effects.

It's highly unusual for a car rental company to charge an extra driver fee for a spouse, but such a surcharge isn't illegal. It is something of a money grab, though. Does it cost the car rental company more if your wife, brother or son drives your rental? No. Will your car insurance cover damage to the vehicle if it's damaged? Check with your insurance company, but I've never heard of an "extra driver" fee having any relevance in a claim that involves a driver's insurance company.
There is currently no recognized limit to the number of properly conducted anesthetics that a healthy younger person may safely receive over a lifetime, or over any specified period of time. We simply do not know whether the same applies to mentally impaired elderly people.

Master's students from overseas usually receive no financial aid for Viterbi's $33,500 annual tuition and fees (housing and other living costs are extra); doctoral students, a much smaller group, often are awarded fellowships.
Sun King's packaging is unique to Indiana -- it's the only brewery in the state canning its beers. "Our decision to can was made before we even had a name," Colt said. "Cans are a really great container for beer. If you think about it, they're like a mini-keg. Cans are lined, they cool down quicker, and they allow no light to spoil (the beer)."
Good game design! Graphics actually aren't that important. I've played Xbox Arcade games with mediocre graphics, but with a good story and polished gameplay, they trumped a lot of the $60 high-end games. So, in order of preference: gameplay, challenge, graphics, story. Everything else I can take or leave.

Instead of avoiding the excellent rays and gnarly surf, she said, people should demand to know more about the chemicals in sunscreen and other products so they can make informed decisions.
The lottery, which Ohioans authorized in 1973, headquartered in Cleveland, has been a patronage nest for both parties. A private manager might be able to run a leaner (hence, more profitable for taxpayers) lottery. But that doesn't mean swinging the other way, to make it extra profitable for corporate friends of the politicians at the expense of taxpayers.
The timing is fortuitous for Gingrich, after a much-criticized answer on illegal immigration at Tuesday's Republican debate. Gingrich may not be "the perfect candidate," the paper writes now. But voters "too often make the mistake of preferring an unattainable ideal to the best candidate who is actually running."

I've tried this several times, and it sure makes me wonder, if people are truly concerned about the high cost of gasoline, why do they continue to drive at speeds that burn it up so fast? I'm not advocating driving at 45 mph, which would probably provoke incidents of "road rage" or at least honking horns, but if we really want to save on our gasoline expense, I think we should ask ourselves which is most important — the few minutes we save by zooming down the highway or the money we are saving to help buy the next tank of gasoline?

Cowboys: They didn't meet with Claiborne at the combine or bring him to Valley Ranch for a pre-draft visit. They didn't even make the standard call in the week before the draft to get an updated phone number. But they are close to the LSU coaches and had all the information they needed. When Blackmon was off the board for the Rams at No. 6, the pick was for sale. Giving up a second-rounder to jump eight spots into the top six for an elite corner at a need position was a reasonable price. Why make the move? Eli Manning threw for almost 800 yards in two games against Rob Ryan's putrid secondary last year.

A: None of his portrayals have moved me or stayed with me, to be honest with you, to the most extreme, whether it be kind of a Mel Brooks approach or more serious ones. None of them really get to me.

Perhaps the most fascinating and inventive of the 14 pieces on the program (the project is planned to ultimately run to 36 commissions) was "I Think About You," Paul Moravec's broad and emotionally turbulent treatment of "Losing My Mind" from "Follies."

"Those two simple acts would generate $1.26 trillion in deficit reduction -- more than the savings from the automatic triggers if the supercommittee does not act. But there are other areas we can look to for savings as well. Ending tax breaks to the 'Big Five' oil companies that reported record profits in the last quarter would save another $20 billion. Ending the sweetheart tax deal enjoyed by hedge fund managers, who pay a lower tax rate than average earners, would save $24 billion.

My knees hurt, I'm on the road away from my family, I'm a bit grumpy, feeling sorry for myself, poor me. And halfway through, I'm starting to have fun, to warm up, and then I have this epiphany, "You stupid old man, you're doing what you love, shut up and skate and just enjoy this." And so the second half, no more thoughts, just music and dance. A coat comes from the ceiling, I put on my tails, a hat comes from the audience and a man throws me my cane, and I go crazy and have a good time. And then my thoughts come back for the bow. And the bow is really silly. "I love bowing. I'm no Scott Hamilton, but I'm not bad." And it's a really fun program to do. I love props and I love hats. I'm addicted to them.

A That certainly I have done on purpose. I like records that have kind of a homemade feel about them so you can hear the human beings at work on them. I think it makes the general public quite nervous. The other reason is that a lot of people who listen to my records are people in the business -- other musicians and producers and people like that. They never buy my records; they get them free. But the payback is I can pick up a cover song if I don't overpolish my stuff. That's how I make my living, is people cover my songs.

* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason. The Blues have taken 1,898 shifts through four games, most among the 16 postseason teams. That's an average 474.5 shifts per game, the most by any of the 16 postseason teams. San Jose is averaging 435.8 shifts per game. On at least one occasion the Blues caught the Sharks in a long, tiring shift and it played a role in B.J. Crombeen's goal that gave the Blues a 1-0 lead in Game 4.

“I really believe that film is an art form, and hopefully if the art is good enough, you’ll want to see it more than once,” he says. “That’s what drew me to Scorsese more than anything — I’d seen his other films so many times, and each time discovered a moment I hadn’t picked up on before. That sort of complexity, that amount of detail — well, I think that’s part of what creates good movies. And those are the kind of movies I want to make. I don’t want to make something that’s just disposable.”

A fountain might sound like a surprising addition when you're thinking water conservation, but even though recirculating fountains lose some water to evaporation and splash-out - the East Bay Municipal Utility District estimates that about 1 to 4 gallons per square foot of water per year gets lost to evaporation from pools - it still uses a lot less than the water lost to a large turf grass lawn, and the pleasure that people take in the sound of water can be well worth the trade-off.
Josh Kovacs (Stiller) is the manager of The Tower, an exclusive Manhattan address for the likes of its owner, Arthur Shaw (Alda), who opens the movie swimming in his pool -- with a giant $100 bill painted on its floor -- atop the high-rise.

* Here's what I'm hoping to see from Adam Wainwright this evening at Wrigley Field: improved command. He's thrown his fastball 50 percent of the time, and it's been hittable, as we know. Opponents are batting .333 against the fastball, with a .704 slugging percentage. But the problem is more location than velocity. Wainwright has left too many fastballs over the belly of the plate; 60 percent have been in the strike zone, and he isn't getting it past many hitters who seem to be looking for it. But it's more than just the fastball; if Wainwright can have sharper command of his secondary pitches, it would make his fastball more effective. The famous Wainwright curve has been all over the place; he's thrown it in the zone only 30 percent of the time. (But on a positive note, he is getting hitters to chase it.) I've said it before, but this is a process for Wainwright. Be patient.
Closer to the quake zone, there were cracks in the studied courtesy. At a gas station in Koriyama, about 130 miles north of Tokyo, some customers become anxious and agitated as fuel ran short, attendants said.

(Students in the next three highest-ranked nations -- Korea, the Netherlands and Japan -- all receive more than 900 hours of instructional time per year.) On the other hand, students in the U.S., which ranked 24th in math scores, spent an average of 799 hours per year in school.
Most readers know Natalie Babbitt for her fantasy, "Tuck Everlasting." This story, set in a small town in Ohio in the 1960s, has no magic. Joe Casimir, ready for junior high, has always lived with his grandmother, but he's packed off to Aunt Myra while Gran recovers from hip replacement. Though the setting is carefully dated (no Internet, no cellphones), the realities of Joe's life -- the way he doesn't talk about his dreams for life, the excitement of finding new friends (including Beatrice and her dog, Rover) -- speak directly to children today. The moon, changing but in a dependable way, presides over Midville. Not even the richest man in town can buy that. Good for family talk.

If they cut 28,000 positions from the Postal Service, I hope about half of them are the people that are up in the penthouse. We need our letter carriers; we don't need the bosses. The bosses just sit at a desk and make stupid decisions. It's the men and women who are out there in the snow, in the heat, delivering mail. And in case you're wondering, no, I'm not a letter carrier and neither is anyone in my family. But I do appreciate the person that brings my mail to me.

In the debate so far, many of the arguments have been based on rhetoric, not fact. It is important to remember that efforts to maximize judicial "independence" from the electorate can also maximize independence from the law and the Constitution. Without a mechanism for effectively holding judges accountable, judges are free to "go rogue" and make decisions based solely on their political views. Is that better than a campaign season every now and then?

Hey, Mike and Frederick: I think the Cavs have varying amounts of interest in the players you suggest, but right now I think they're focusing on the lottery and draft to see how they can improve the team. They have stated their intention to be aggressive in an effort to use the trade exception, but I'm not sure any of those players will be made available by their teams and I doubt the Cavs can get three players of the caliber mentioned in Frederick's email.

Once again, Connecticut won’t start too far from home on its way to the Final Four as it takes the top seed only 59 miles away from campus. The Huskies will have extra incentive to get out of the bracket because a potential rematch with Notre Dame awaits. Remember, the Irish knocked out UConn in the same stage last year.

Tooloulou doesn't have an official dessert menu, but it serves milkshakes and root beer floats made with ice cream from Prigel Family Creamery. During our visit, the dessert special was strawberry shortcake made with Lagergren's sweet biscuits ,which were the size of a salad plate, fresh strawberries and barely whipped sweet cream ($6). The shortcake teetered on the edge of sweet —- some of us thought it should be more sugary — but the biscuit alone, with its tender texture and slight crumble, was worth the price (and the calories).

(Some signs of a houseplant in need of roomier digs: It's top-heavy for the pot, or when roots start emerging from the existing pot's drainage holes.)

The Predators have their sights set on building on what they accomplished last season, when they won the first playoff series in franchise history. That was a cause of celebration in Nashville, because they had to start somewhere.

1999: Should Wisconsin pull off the upset over Oregon on Jan. 2, the 1999 season would probably slide down to second best of all time in Wisconsin football history.

J Mello describes himself as a rapper, but he sings straight through "Torture," a guitar-pop song about his girlfriend's serial cheating. Get set for a narrative as linear as a bullet train, and where it's heading is nowhere you'd want to be: unable to quit a lover who keeps messing around with your buddies. Give J Mello credit for emotional honesty, and hope that names have been changed to protect the (not so) innocent.

The Sept. 21 and 22 shows at MetLife Stadium conflict with another major music event taking place in the Garden State that weekend: All Tomorrow's Parties in Asbury Park. There is not likely to be too much overlap between the ATP audience and the Springsteen crowd, but the Boss has been reaching many younger listeners with "Wrecking Ball" -- which made its debut atop the Billboard 200 -- and his star turn at South By Southwest has helped re-establish him as a musician whose moves tastemakers cannot ignore. Don't be surprised if many ATP fans find themselves torn.

First, I think about the very fact of Harvard. It was founded in 1636, just 15 years after that desperate first Thanksgiving.

“What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns,” Rushkoff wrote. “That's because, unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop (as in the election of Obama), this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc.

Saying that Measure B would impose unfair limits on disabled cops, he pointed out that Constant is getting a 50 percent disability pension, which he claimed was a sweeter deal than a cop in a wheelchair might get in certain cases. ("It's not surprising that Ash resorted to personal attacks; that's what people do when they can't win on the facts," Constant told me by email later.) Edge: No question. Judge Weissbrodt. The crowd left satisfied.
Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, says 23% of U.S. taxpayers don't make enough money to owe that tax once they take their personal exemption and standard deduction. Another 23% qualify for tax breaks that bring their bill to zero or provide a refund.

As part of AB 32 and other recent legislation, California is requiring businesses generating over 4 cubic yards of garbage per week to recycle.

The weekend is here, as is PIFF, but so is the worst day of the year. Well, the Worst Day of the Year Ride, anyway.

Without further ado, here are some ideas for what to make of your weekend, in the form of a lovingly curated list of Portland events.

But you and I know this is a reality show first and foremost and the only thing that keeps "The Voice" from joining the ranks of such long running reality shows like "Survivor," "The Apprentice" or "The Bachelor" is the absence of a Nasty Elimination Round Catch Phrase like "You're fired!" "Please pack your knives and go," "Your tour ends here," "The tribe has spoken," "Ding Dong, the door's for you." "Give me your jacket and leave" or "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. You're dead to us." All right, I don't even know where that last one came from, but the fact that there's a directory of these phrases tells me that "The Voice" should have one too.
The nurse pushed play, and our intimate audience was transported to PubertyLand. Unlike the videos I suffered through in middle school, this production included actual actors, story lines and realistic scenes. Super supportive parents with soothing voices guided their confused children through baffling issues like oily skin and maxi pads. I sat back smugly. My daughter and I had this puberty thing in the bag.

A: I specifically wanted to do that. (Azaria's character) has gone from being a suburban dad to being a guy living in this apartment. We wanted a medium-sized city that allowed easy access to suburban and urban areas. I've always loved Portland, but we shoot in L.A. We do have our little magical backdrops that locate us in three different random locations in (Portland). I think the boss can see Mount Hood from his window. We're trying to figure out how to imitate the reality of Portland rain, grayness, trees, things like that. I know we already have one reference to a Timbers game.
What is rare is for members to acknowledge such transgressions. The outrage over the infamous 2005 attempt by Sen. Carole Migden to cast a vote for one of her bills when it was in the Assembly was an aberration.

Sarah Silverman, Dana Gould and David Spade share some laughs at the OneKid OneWorld Comedy Night
Why it makes sense: Owner Woody Johnson is a big thinker and has a past record of taking chances with veteran quarterbacks in these kinds of situations, not to mention the Jets are a team still built to win now. Also, there are the trust and leadership issues that have been bouncing around the offense, and no one would quiet the masses like Peyton Manning, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
Dogs figure in this year's presidential campaign. Already I've seen bumper stickers for "Dogs Against Romney." The phrase results from a Romney family trip to Canada in 1983, when Mitt put Seamus, their Irish setter, in a carrier strapped to the roof of their car. Seamus responded with diarrhea, and Mitt had to hose down the car when they stopped for gas.

Daniel AddyTen Tiny Dances is curated by the format's creator, Mike Barber, shown here at an outdoor Ten Tiny performance in 2008.One of the virtues of Mike Barber's popular performance series Ten Tiny Dances is its simplicity.

A character known as "Big Block Bruce" in Ohio found two Chevrolet engines manufactured within a week of each other in July 1966, and those went into the boat. The company that manufactured the vinyl located the original dies for vinyl used on the Rivas, and they retooled some machines to make vinyl for this project — with exactly the correct grain.

It's a telling image, at once fanciful and suggestive. That lightness of being which Max experiences on a personal level was felt more widely, for example, by thousands of immigrants whose records were destroyed by the quake and fire.

At Riva in Santa Monica, Fraiche's Jason Travi is zeroing in on the pizza front, too, taking his inspiration from the Italian Riviera. The crust has had some glitches, mostly in consistency, but he's been working on it. You can see the wood-burning oven just inside the open kitchen -- not a beauty, but functional. He's got a winner with his Molto Maiale pizza, which is very much in the Molto Mario (Batali) style: More has got to be better. This one is topped with meatballs, sausage, pancetta and bacon. There's a simple potato, Fontina and sea salt pie and a Margherita made with bufala mozzarella. Mushroom, though, seems more like duxelles spread thinly over the crust: not a success. He may be trying too hard to be original.

Actually, both theories are correct -- and neither is. It's true that Wall Street took too many risks while government regulators watched passively; it's also true that the government's aggressive promotion of homeownership contributed to real estate speculation. But the fact that these theories are not mutually exclusive suggests that both were consequences of some larger cause. Just so. What ultimately explains the financial crisis and Great Recession is an old-fashioned boom and bust, of which the housing collapse was merely a part.

The Berkeley team is also focusing on a more recent period of mysterious climate change called the Younger Dryas that began about 13,000 years ago and lasted a little more than 1,000 years.

Those sums pale beside the largest dues deal that Hodgson found: Comerica paid $202,928, including an initiation fee, for CEO Ralph Babb to join a club in Dallas. Babb, incidentally, is a former St. Louisan; he once worked for Mercantile Bank. Comerica received a cash infusion from the U.S. Treasury's TARP program, and TARP requires recipients to have a "luxury expenditures policy." Apparently, though, it doesn't require them to quit paying for luxuries.

He's right. As such, the leading candidates are issuing tough-talking news releases. Their aides are portraying the opposition as unelectable or dishonest. Charges and countercharges are flying. YouTube videos that mock the candidates are popping up. And, of course, hard-hitting mailings are landing in the mailboxes of Republicans in the 5th District, which stretches from segments of Broad Ripple all the way north to Marion. The district also includes Hamilton County and Zionsville.

"The last three outings of spring training are when you look at guys, especially power pitchers, to get it in order," said Acta. "Hopefully, that was the last one and it's out of him. But the command wasn't there at all. You need to get through four innings with less than 80 pitches."

And Romney? You have to hand it to him. He never delivers a knockout punch. He never gets off the best line. He never dazzles. But he never loses his purpose, he says everything he wants and needs to say, he doesn’t get flustered, and he is fluent and purposeful.

Back in the '60s, said Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, Chicago teachers were highly compensated compared to many suburbs, but "that has changed drastically and we have tougher conditions.

Black: That was one of the things that drew me to the project, that it was a change of pace from the wacky comedies that I'd done in the past. It was a chance to do something more real.
An Arizona State University report issued last month concluded that the project could produce $2.2 billion in new economic activity over its lifetime, with half of that sum remaining in Pinal County. Experts at the school's L. William Seidman Research Institute also predicted up to 680 jobs annually for 28 years.

I didn't feel like doing much early, but I dragged myself to the treadmill and followed my cardio-plan printout. Quite frankly, I'm beginning to get sick of being forced to drag myself to the treadmill day after day. It's not that I'm not motivated; I am. I very much want to change my physique inside of six months. I just wish I had more bounce in my step during the process.
Shattenkirk and Pietrangelo each finished with 43 points last season, but 26 of Shattenkirk's points came with Colorado before St. Louis acquired him in February 2011. With each reaching the 40-point plateau this season, they became the first Blues' defensive pair since Chris Pronger and Al MacInnis in 2001-02 to accomplish it. That season, Pronger had 47 points and MacInnis 46.
Incumbent Councilwoman Tina Vick faces challengers Adam Varner and Victor Albea.
Buick's Interactive Drive Control, optional on the Regal Turbo and standard on the GS, adds an adaptive suspension. In the GS, it has regular, Sport and GS settings. The Regal Turbo gets regular, Touring and Sport settings. In the Regal GS, GS mode reduces power-steering assist and stiffens the suspension, but the differences in ride comfort are slim. GS mode improves steering feedback at higher speeds, but no matter the setting the wheel still turns with light effort around town. That's something I prefer, though driving enthusiasts may want higher-effort steering.
Madonna's tour in support of new album "MDNA" will kick off May 31 at Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv, two days later than previously announced. Promoters said Thursday the change was caused by production delays.

And Smith can’t wait to add Bradley to the mix next fall. Missouri, which returns 10 NCAA qualifiers and several Big 12 champions, is looking for redemption after a disappointing showing at this year’s NCAA championships, where the Tigers failed to crown an All-American for the first time since 2001.
But in January 2011, relaxed and warming herself by the fireplace after a winter romp outside with her husband, Don Neilson, and son, Theo, she found another lump <U+0097> this one grape-sized <U+0097> wedged between her breast implant and skin.
As mentioned, creation isn't an issue. The Blues are developing plenty of scoring chances to tip games to their side. Over the past five starts, a 4-0-1 stretch, the Blues have 177 shots on goal to
By the time we ate the second cheese, the rind was a burnt orange with black spots, which the book said was fine — it's only if you start to see blue spots that the cheese is spoiling. Perhaps, but this one ended up being overripe and slightly ammoniac. This was probably due to the lack of circulating air, I learned after the fact.
In addition, Amsterdam Ave. will be closed between 106th St. and 110th St. from 9 a.m.- 6 p.m. Sunday. In Brooklyn, Court St. from Union to W. Ninth Sts. will be closed noon to 6 p.m. Sunday.
Principal clarinetist Franklin Cohen eclipsed Minkowski in the second work, "Gnarly Buttons," by John Adams, masterfully holding his own in this alternately raucous and tender concerto from 1996 despite variable support.
"It's a huge disappointment," O'Reilly said. "Obviously she's been a massive part of this team. I've really loved playing with her on the right side, but it doesn't seem like it's worst case scenario, so that's good. I'm sure she'll be back soon. She's a tough person. I'm confident we'll have her back."
Martin was slain in the town of Sanford on Feb. 26 in a shooting that has set off a nationwide furor over race and justice.

He enjoys creating weekly specials for the restaurant, and he even fulfills special requests.
On both nights I dined at Gram & Dun, the waiters made a special plug for the Jar of Budino (that's Italian for pudding) served in a stout apothecary jar. But the butterscotch-flavored pudding was one dimensional, and slightly grainy. The Butter Popcorn Ice Cream Sundae sounded vaguely intriguing but really wasn't that different from the Gram & Dun Bar, which looks and tastes like the Little Debbie Nutty Bars my mom used to pack in my lunch when I was a kid. I'd like something less rich and fruity <U+0097> a cobbler maybe?

The Lakers have now won 12 of their last 13 games, and their only loss since the all-star break was a nail biter at Miami. In their last 10 games, they’ve held their opponents to around 87 points per game. As much as we were searching for ways that Portland could score late in this game, and starting to blame the Blazer offense, most of the credit goes to the L.A. defense.
The White House criticized Congress for voting to cut off unemployment benefits with the holiday break approaching.
The cancer-causing byproduct of nuclear fission was detected in basins at the Salem 2 reactor on Tuesday at a level of 1.1 million picocuries per liter, compared with the federal safety standard for drinking water of 20,000 picocuries per liter, the story said. A spokesman for the plant's owner, PSE&G, told the newspaper the findings were not significant enough to require they be reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but they reported it to the agency voluntarily on Wednesday night.

The exhibits inside the museum are a timeline of the civil rights movement. Visitors can walk through a Birmingham city bus in use at the time that Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. Newspaper headlines and black-and-white television news reports paint a picture of unease, chaos, change. A replica of a burned Greyhound bus is next to the story of the Freedom Riders, who fought for voting rights; a replica of a jail cell is a reminder of when King was imprisoned.

Then I add in the Golden Globes (knowing they’re a joke, but realizing all the Hollywood hype they create) and the awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (because the industry is so full of, and intimidated by, British talent). I also look at the prizes given out by the industry’s three big professional groups — the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild and the Producers Guild.

For example, the Schwarzenegger administration has argued repeatedly with the federal government that the measurement of noncompliance for the CalWorks work requirement is unrealistic, rigid and inaccurate. Now he's using it to resurrect the specter of rampant welfare "moms." He claims that self-sufficiency reviews could save $1.5 billion a year. In his May revise of the state budget, Schwarzenegger put the number at $100 million.

He believes the practice of birthright citizenship rests on a misconstruing of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court, he says, has never addressed the "precise question" of the meaning of this: "All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."
The test GS was a surprise on many levels. Exterior styling was upscale and not brawny, even though rocker panels, a different grille and a slightly lower-to-the-pavement stance differentiated it from other Regals.

Certain drugs used for children and pregnant women aren't officially approved by the FDA since these groups are difficult to involve in clinical trials.

Cleveland had won six in a row and 11 of 13 games in the series before last season. The Blazers own a 60-48 all-time advantage in the series thanks to a 37-17 edge in Portland. This will be the only meeting between the teams this season.

Once back home, he fought an insurance company for a year to get a prosthetic leg that his doctors recommended.
It's the first time the EPA has required air pollution controls at hydraulically fractured, or fracked, wells.

Merkel and Sarkozy also said they did not want to increase the size of the EU's 440 billion euro rescue fund, which may have to take over a massive, multibillion euro European Central Bank program to support the prices of Spanish and Italian bonds by buying them up on the open market. The ECB spent 22 billion euros ($32 billion) in the first week of the program alone and says it wants to hand off that responsibility in coming months to the rescue fund, or European Financial Stability Facility.
Some board members expressed concern over labeling an account exclusively for Twin Echo, but would be in favor of setting money aside for future construction projects. The district recently applied for a $5 million early childhood construction grant, that if awarded, would be used to turn Twin Echo into an early childhood education center and get rid of the portable classrooms. The district would be responsible for 10 percent of the grant amount, $500,000.

"I don't know what was going on," Buckley said. "I was feeling good before I was jumping. I just had a lot in my head because different events the coaches wanted me to try out. I'm not saying that I don't want to, but I'm not really ready for it."

Meanwhile, Republicans have drawn a line in the sand, at least when it comes to a seat on the Court of Appeals. Should the Republicans take back the White House in 2012, the Democrats will have little choice but to reciprocate with this new interpretation of "extraordinary circumstances." That will result in an increasingly short-staffed judiciary that lacks the services of highly qualified individuals who had the misfortune of ever having an opinion, or even an appearance of one.
"We do have the facility shut down at this time," Ficken said.

Over the course of a day, students work in small groups on cases from beginning to end, with all that entails — from discussing strategies, to surveillance and going undercover, to appearing before judges to request search warrants.
Romney, a virtual lock to be Obama's Republican opponent in the November election, has employed some rhetorical gymnastics on the campaign trail to criticize Obama's handling of the auto bailouts, while cheering the survival of General Motors and Chrysler, and even -- in Ohio on Monday -- saying that he, Romney, deserves "a lot of credit" for the auto industry revival because he suggested managed bankruptcies for GM and Chrysler.
The annual event takes place at comics shops around the country, many of which celebrate with special deals and artist appearances. But the real kicker is the free comic books, which seem to get better every year.
Surgeons removed affected lymph nodes but within months tumors appeared in her liver, breast, skull and other lymph nodes. "My oncologist said this is going to kill you and you need to think about preparing for that," Anderson says.

As his reputation grew throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Husain showed a talent for hyping his life and escapades, which only raised the value of his work. "Life without a bit of drama is too drab," he said on one occasion. "If I'd been in Europe, I would've been more gimmicky than Salvador Dali," he said on another.
The Cardinals expected pitching to be their strength this season. So the loss of Chris Carpenter for at least a few months punches a hole in their rotation. Even if Lance Lynn does a solid job filling in, the Cards will miss Carpenter's leadership and his love of big-game challenges. Adam Wainwright will fill some of the leadership void, but a hole will remain.
The press for large donors by both parties has intensified in the wake of recent Supreme Court rulings that allow individuals and corporations to spend unlimited sums on independent campaign efforts.

Many vegan dishes, however, are already beloved; we eat fruit salad, peanut butter and jelly, beans and rice, eggplant in marinara sauce. The problem faced by many of us - brought up as we were with plates whose center was filled with a piece of an animal - is in imagining less-traditional vegan dishes that are creative, filling, interesting and not especially challenging to either put together or enjoy.
Not exactly a country-folk album, "The Secret Sisters" is more like an Americana version of Maddy Prior and June Tabor’s Silly Sisters project: standards associated with male vocalists wryly reinterpreted by a pair of talented young women. They pinch "Somethin’ Stupid" from Sinatra, warm up George Jones’ "Why Baby Why," and turn their tart tongues on two Hank Williams chestnuts. This project was overseen by T Bone Burnett, which means the traditionalist bona fides are unimpeachable.

When Chicago went two full days without a shooting back in January, Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, in our view, gave his department way too much credit for the brief respite from violence. Crime rates go up or down in the short run for all sorts of reasons, we wrote at the time, with the quality of police work being just one. Sure enough, shootings were up by the end of January.

Revelations of neglect, theft and other misconduct by guardians and conservators prompted Minnesota lawmakers to strengthen oversight of the unlicensed profession in 2009, but advocates say the system still falls short. While guardians and conservators must register with the courts by 2013, they are not required to pass any tests or possess any specialized skills. Applicants are required to submit to a criminal background check, but court officials don't have to determine whether applicants have been disciplined for misconduct by a state licensing board.

Terrell has served since 2000. Murphy, of Hunting Valley, was appointed last year by then-Commissioner Tim Hagan, who now works part-time for MetroHealth. In an unusual move, commissioners appointed Murphy to replace a departing board member, then moved him into the last year of another trustee's term. That trustee started a new six-year term.

Following the news about whether high-fructose corn syrup, or HFCS, is bad for you or not is a lot like watching professional table tennis: You could get whiplash trying to keep up. However, many of the favorable studies are from HFCS manufacturers or associations, and we don't think their data are great. Besides, there's growing evidence that avoiding this cheap sugar replacement could help you avoid heart disease, stroke and diabetes, not to mention wrinkles and impotence.

His opinion is entitled to change, but if Booker is labeling Vanderbeek “one of the most despicable owners” in the NHL, we’ll just assume he’s too busy tweeting to keep up with the league.

Pippa Middleton media frenzy: When Prince William and Kate Middleton got hitched, the lovely sister of the bride (who rocked her curve-skimming maid of honor dress) got the attention she deserved. Then came the Pippa photo spreads about her wardrobe choices. And the who's-Pippa-dating stories. Now the British tabloids have dubbed as Gungate the scandalous pictures of her seated next to a convertible-driving guy brandishing what looks like a weapon -- and the American media is also fascinated by the flap. Enough. Let's move on to other topics with a brisk pip, pip, cheerio.
