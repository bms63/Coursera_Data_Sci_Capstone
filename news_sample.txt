Then, a plot twist. Red Springs must, by the terms of its operator's agreement, use the facility as a cafe, and not just for catering.

Indeed, much of "West Cross Timbers," Shires’ first solo record, felt as indebted to Willa Cather and Eudora Welty as it does to Emmylou Harris or Dolly Parton. "Carrying Lightning," a collection of love stories, simply seems like the diary entries of a woman whose wanderlust is barely contained by her small town circumstances. Shires, who takes her lyrics as seriously as any prose writer, often uses assignments and exercises to spark her creativity.

Radon. A naturally occurring radioactive gas, it's a byproduct of the breakdown of uranium and is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States, he says. "It comes up out of the soil, hits the foundation and comes up into the homes and builds up to dangerous levels in the indoor air." Radon test kits range in price from $9 to $25. More information about radon and testing is at the Oregon Radon Program's website (healthoregon.org/radon).

Manufacturing is doing quite well. One sector that didn't add jobs is government, which is still adjusting to tight budgets and probably will for some time. 8.3 percent unemployment is still terrible. There are almost 13 million unemployed. There are 5 million long-term unemployed. But if the unemployment rate descends to the low-7-percent range by November, it will substantially improve the Democrats' chances to hold on to the White House.

In the case of “Tiny Toons,” Warner Bros. made an old favorite new again without changing the formula, just the subjects. “Tiny Toons” was the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. The partnership was so successful, especially among adults, that “Animaniacs” quickly followed. Just like the original, these shows were a blend of sight gags, wackiness, pop culture references, and stylized, animated violence.

Santorum's conservatism has some jagged edges, which has elevated Romney's polling numbers among women.

I often bracket my trips to Hawaii with a stay in the Honolulu area on the way in and out. Arriving in Hawaii, I like the Moana Surfrider, The Breakers or the Outrigger Reef to jump right into the ocean and enjoy a little nightlife. But as my pace slows with a trip to the more languid pleasures of Kauai or Lanai, I find the Kahala is the perfect spot for the final night before heading back home. I get one last day of isolation and beauty before it's back to bumper-to-bumper on I-5.

Among the few food-poisoning outbreaks that resulted in a criminal conviction was the case against juicemaker Odwalla, which sold apple juice tainted with E. coli in 1996. Odwalla - the company but not individual executives - pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges in 1998 after the juice killed a toddler in Denver and sickened more than 60 others. The California juicemaker was sentenced to five years' probation and forced to pay a $1.5 million fine after pleading guilty to 16 misdemeanor charges for "delivering adulterated food products."
"I've seen the evolution," said Jeff Dean, a backcountry ski patrol expert who has worked in the ski and snowboard industry for 19 years. "There's a lot of hype now. They look at these guys jumping off cliffs, that radical stuff they're doing in the movies, all the jumps, terrain, 20-foot air, and they want to do it. That's the way it's going. I've done it too, even in the trees. I broke a rib."
As a fan favorite, Joel often draws cheers that are disproportionate to his actual productivity. Then again, he is a 7-footer who averaged 5.1 rebounds in 16 minutes last season - and that's not the easiest thing to find. Assuming Przybilla is available for the entire season, he would be an asset to Portland's roster if he comes off the bench. He doesn't cost much, won't complain about his minutes, and will enthusiastically perform inglorious duties like screen-setting and charge-taking.

What scientists didn't know was whether there was a threshold below which drinking was safe, Chen says. Because of the number of women in the Nov. 1 study — more than 100,000 women, of whom 7,690 developed breast cancer over the 28-year study period — the authors were able to examine this.
Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger). There's also a castaway (Jenny Slate) who one-ups Tom Hanks by conversing with not one but five face-painted balls (tennis, golf, basket-, base- and Nerf foot-).
Aspiring designers come up with a signature design, getting input from celebrity mentors Jessica Simpson (who describes a convertible skirt as a "twofer"), Nicole Richie (who quips that she is going to need a sailboat to get out of the studio because one of the designers is prone to tears), and high-profile designer John Varvatos (who seems above it all).

Another bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter increases minimum wages for workers who earn tips. They are not covered by current state laws, but federal regs say they must get at least $2.13 per hour base pay, and if tips don’t bring them up to minimum wage, employers must supplement them. Sumter’s bill, which has no Senate counterpart, requires workers who rely on tips to get base pay of at least 40 percent of the prevailing minimum wage, supplemented as needed. Such workers haven’t seen an increase in base pay since 1991, although tips probably rose as the cost of meals and travel went up.

When he turned 11, the Stockdale, Ohio, native told his father he wanted to be a race-car driver, and Roger Veach, amazingly, believed him.
Lawrence, with her determined scowl and aura of hyper-awareness, anchors the movie, as she should. Hutcherson is funny, stoic, steady-on as her running mate - as in running for their lives. Harrelson is less hammy than you'd imagine, given his wardrobe, mock-tragic mien, and pronouncements along the lines of "Embrace the probability of your imminent death!"

Notes: Knicks G Mike Bibby came out of one of his shoes during play early in the second quarter, then was miffed after Wade picked up the sneaker and tossed it out of his reach as New York took the ball into the offensive end. "I don't think many people have done that before," Wade said. ...

It makes no sense, except in one place in the world, the place where it started, on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. And though they come down from that mountain and go about their lives, they keep going back to it, over the course of years, because however much the love doesn't make sense, it's real -- so real, it makes their lives unreal. There are kids, marriages, jobs, nights of drinking, heterosexual flings, in-laws and holidays to celebrate, and they do everything they're expected to do, but numb. Then every so often, they meet back up on the mountain and get to be themselves for a few stolen days. The situation carries a lot of emotional power, largely because it's so specific and yet undefined.

But I surely left the candles smoldering, their wax, still-malleable globs sinking down in the frosting as though trapped in cream-cheese quicksand as I sped out the door at the stroke of age 16, heading to the Sunnyvale DMV with my mom in tow.

On the roster: It's one of the strongest, deepest positions on the team, but don't be surprised if the Lions draft a defensive lineman early. Cliff Avril hasn't signed his franchise tender and is a fair bet to leave in free agency without a long-term deal.

The Lions drafted first-round defensive tackles each of the last two years and have more stability at the position, though Sammie Hill and Corey Williams can both be free agents after the season.

"It doesn't matter if you're Kenny Cooper, Eddie Johnson or Jorge Perlaza. ... we're evaluating everyone every single day," Spencer said. "Just because you start in the first game of the season doesn't mean you're going to start in the 10th or 20th game of the season."
Tube testing of unit 2 is complete, Manfre said. But neither reactor will be restarted until all testing and assessments have been completed.

Before and after his Navy years, McFarlane was a respiratory therapy technician at an Alabama hospital, an experience he credited with helping him know his way around healthcare.
The lead singer and force of nature in Alabama Shakes, rock 'n' roll's newest phenomenon, already had a good job delivering mail <U+0097> and she hoped to hold onto it.
The screenwriters, who control everything (Mr. Goddard got his start on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," the TV series created by Mr. Whedon), have filled their film with big ideas. "The Cabin in the Woods" simultaneously celebrates and deconstructs the genre's conventions, while touching on questions of ethics as they apply to reality shows, and free will as it applies to all of us contestants in the game of real life, clinging as we do to the belief that we run our own shows. Yet the initial brilliance of the premise is eventually dulled by illogic, the whole thing proves unmanageable and the filmmakers unmanage their climactic revelation with far more zest than finesse.
Sovereign Partners, a private real estate investment firm, purchased the property formerly known as Visteon Village for $81.1 million, according to a news release.
Yet another Kirov prodigy, Ekaterina Kondaurova, teamed with the ardent Marcelo Gomes in excerpts from the "Black Swan" Pas de Deux. Their performance was scintillating, and there is no discounting the authority that Kondaurova’s Maryinsky style brings to her performance in "La Bayadère." Skillful and intriguing partnering in duets from Frederick Ashton’s "A Month in the Country" and John Cranko’s "Onegin" made these pieces compelling additions to the program.
The engine is also one of the highlights of the Azera; power is smoothly modulated and is more than enough for a car this size, with zero to 60 mph coming in 6.6 seconds, according to Motor Trend.
The general fund portion of proposed budget is anticipated to be about $26.15 million. The sum is $628,892, or about 2.5%, higher than what is anticipated to be spent during the current academic year.

Umenyiora isn’t expected to change his stance or his approach anytime soon, according to someone who spoke with him tonight. The person, who requested anonymity because Umenyiora hasn’t talked about his situation publicly, said the two-time Pro Bowl selection isn’t planning to practice Thursday.
A gauge of private-sector hiring showed weakness in April, the latest data to suggest the labor market has cooled a bit from its healthy early-year pace.
For all the questions about manufacturing's viability in the region, the remaining Orange County factories make goods that are typically positioned in a comparative sweet spot – higher-end, technically savvy products that are in high demand in an extra-efficiency driven world.
The changes affecting teachers will not take effect until their current contract expires next year.
Traditionally, it's been essential to have audiences tune in to sample a new show. But our media environment now allows viewers to watch anytime they wish, if they have a DVR. Will that give "Grimm" a chance to reach those viewers who are now going to be glued to baseball? And will NBC rerun the debut episode? (I'm thinking they will.) Stay tuned, as they say.
District officials originally proposed sending Clackamas students to just Sunnyside and Duncan, which would have kept the students in the Clackamas High feeder system. But some expressed concerns about the distance to Duncan, leading to the addition of nearby Bilquist.
"I have been playing with her for so long, I know how she plays and where she is going to shoot," she said. "Playing against her pumps me up. I mean who would want to lose to their twin sister? The worst part is probably that she is an amazing athlete and is very feisty."
The German-born Goerne brings together elegance, warmth and suppleness of phrasing with the rarified ability to identify with and express the meaning of his material. The Norwegian Andsnes has a sublime way of channeling his technical gifts into music-making that keeps the spotlight on the composer without mortgaging his own spirited personality or intelligence. Both Goerne and Andsnes are storytellers of the first-rank. This promises to be a special evening.
"As Directors of a gaming company privileged to hold licenses, we have a duty to uphold the highest ethical standards and comply with the laws and the terms of the licenses upon which our business depends," said a statement by Bob Miller, former Nevada governor and a director of Wynn Resorts who chairs the company's compliance committee. "Unfortunately, it is very clear from the Freeh Report that Mr. Okada repeatedly flouted these requirements."
A low-budget take on the 1950s Starkweather-Fugate murder spree (the same crimes that also inspired Terence Malick's "Badlands"), director George Hood's movie, filmed in Portland in 1974, was nationally distributed with the title "Stark Raving Mad," and today is difficult to find anywhere. It's worth seeing for its place in Oregon film history alone: long before today's fertile, celebrated film scene, here was an independent feature production starring Portland actors and using mostly Portland crew members. Hood and producer-writer Don Gronquist will be on hand to present the movie.
Maybe if I stick pins in my keyboard, I can give my forehead acupuncture.
Cunningham was cleared to play just prior to tipoff in the Blazers’ last game, a 109-103 victory over the Chicago Bulls at the Rose Garden, but McMillan elected not to play him. It was the first game the second-year player has missed all season.

"I think the city owes us $100,000," Greenspan said during the meeting. "I am not going to support this crosswalk for $1 or $37,000 until we get our $100,000 back."
You know it worked out pretty slick for you. You didn’t have to break Stanford’s tradition and send me flowers for the Prom. I hope someone got to use the bid ... I hope you won your game last nite and aren’t too sore today. I’m sure you did real well. Bro’s team sure is going great guns. They’ve won 13 straight games ... I suppose I shouldn’t tell you this, but I kind of miss you and it’s going to seem odd not seeing you this weekend. Does that boost your vanity?

Late afternoon, Feb. 21, 2008, customers at the ATM outside a downtown Wachovia bank called Tampa police to report a ponytailed man with a stack of debit or credit cards making transaction after transaction.
The Republicans stand for smaller government, to let people keep more of their hard-earned money and work their way up the ladder of prosperity. The American dream is to be self-sufficient, entrepreneurial and productive in our great society. To be sure, we all need to help the truly needy along the way to success, but when people take from the successful (rich) and give to the poor, they ruin the incentive of both.
"We can talk all day long about how bikes are a practical tool that can help anyone who can't afford a car or can't get to work on TriMet or just wants to feel healthier or make their neighborhood safer," said Alison Graves, executive director of the Community Cycling Center, a nonprofit that aims to get more people behind handlebars. "But there is a fundamental disconnect between the perception and the reality. We have a culture that can drive people off."
Jodi Sandfort, the academic co-director of the leadership center, was a special assistant to Bruininks starting in 2008, working with him and the Bush Foundation on a separate initiative. Bush Foundation grants to the center have totaled $320,000 since August 2010.
The draft is good for one thing and one thing only: It is a nationally televised truth serum. After all the blather and smoke thrown out by NFL teams, the reality leaks out when they finally must make their picks. That's when you discover what the teams truly believe they need, the areas where they think they are most lacking, the roster crevices that they are most desperate to fill.
Allen could have faced the death penalty, but a juror left the panel during that phase of the trial because of his mother's death. Prosecutors agreed to waive the death penalty to avoid a new trial.
It starts at the top, doesn't it?
The figures were only available at the state level. Separate studies which focus on counties and metro areas have shown the St. Louis region to be slightly negative on so-called "domestic migration" in recent years.
In the past, scarring and disfigurement through various methods of tattoo removal made the tattoo area uglier than before. The advances in laser technology have made the process easier and the results more successful in many cases.
Gallup's initial tracking poll found that an equal number of Republicans and Democrats -- 90% -- say they support their nominee. Independents broke 45% for Romney to 39% for Obama. He also won, 46% to 39%, among independents in the Quinnipiac poll. But CNN had independents favoring Obama, 48% to 43%.
Only 10 of the 886 scripts Ensemble Studio Theatre received for this year’s one-act-play marathon made the cut. It’s a pity, then, that so many of those are underwhelming. “Marathon 2010: Series B,” like its predecessor, Series A, is highly uneven, with the best stuff coming after intermission.
Rae Armantrout's static feedback, often fragmentary and playful, ("Give a meme/ a hair-do"), belies an underlying peacefulness of contemplation: "It's well/ that things should stir/ inconsequentially/ around me." "Money Shot" (Wesleyan) is a fine follow-up to Armantrout's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Versed."
Both opponents and supporters of SB 5 acknowledge the referendum is surely headed to the ballot because We Are Ohio turned in more than five times the required 231,000 valid signatures for the referendum to qualify.

"The challenge is that the most radical action, particularly if it's violent, is going to get the most attention," Meyer said. "The broader Occupy movement runs the risk of being discredited by its own radical flank."
-- Justin Tuck comes off the field holding his shoulder. It's the left shoulder, which bothered him on Friday and was surgically repaired last week.
"It is nothing against Hector, he still will be in there in the ninth, but you're looking at a guy with a body of work against those three guys," Ventura said. "I felt confident leaving Matt in there."
There will be more, says Barnes, when the city wrestles with how to develop the Baylands - 660 acres north of Brisbane Lagoon between Highway 101 and Bayshore Boulevard.
The maturity kicked in once Barnes started driving to the basket more often to eliminate the Golden Eagles’ defensive effectiveness. He scored his first two points of the game on a dunk with 13 minutes to go in the first half and didn’t slow down after.
More than $182 million has been raised for the arts center’s endowment, operations, upkeep and cash reserve, NJPAC officials said. Although more than $80 million has already been used to subsidize the arts center’s annual operations, the funds provide a safety net for the institution as well as reserves for capital improvements and upkeep, they said.

Baltimore police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III said the gunman, 50-year-old Warren Davis, shot his mother, Jean Davis, in her hospital room. The doctor, who was not identified, had been telling Davis about his mother's condition when the man "became emotionally distraught and reacted ... and was overwhelmed by the news of his mother's condition," Bealefeld said.

Lewis was in the studio with Carl Perkins when they were joined by Presley and Cash for an impromptu jam session. The foursome was dubbed “The Million Dollar Quartet.”
It wasn't enough to stave off an all-too-familiar playoff result for Anthony, who was chosen two spots behind James and immediately ahead of Bosh and Wade in the 2003 NBA draft. Anthony has been in 11 postseason series, winning just two, the won-lost record of his teams in those games a mere 17-37.
Bicycle and pedestrian programs "believe it or not, caused the most anguish and were the hardest to come to an accord on," Fowler said. She said the Senate bill scales back each of the programs to some extent, such as allowing governors to opt out of spending for recreational trails to divert the money to highways.

FOREST GROVE - M. LaRayne Peschka, 92, died March 2, 2012, at Vintage Suites Retirement Community.
Was the act of pulling away from mainstream American culture too hard on the traditional family unit? Melissa, who loved her childhood and her parents, doesn't have the answers. But her memoir is an important piece of the puzzle. Today we both admire and ridicule such attempts at countercultures. The Colemans and the Nearings were not hippies or druggies or even, for the most part, political protesters. They worked hard to create an alternative economy that still exists and is growing in rural America. This memoir is evidence of their great sacrifices.
"It's my understanding that the money is said to come from an inheritance after his grandmother's death, but there is no paper trail," the source said. "If it was an inheritance, it wasn't handled correctly."
A mountain of research does exist showing how children are often affected by divorce. By and large, children of divorce are more likely than other kids to suffer from depression, delinquent behavior or poor school performance. These harsh realities remain even when parents make all the "right" decisions to help their children through divorce.
A modest Walsh said many people at the rest area helped save Nicolette's life. He also said he was worried about her husband, who was in complete shock after his longtime wife came back from the brink of death.

Alex Strick van Linschoten, one of the anthology's coeditors, said he had collected the 240-odd poems off the Internet and in the field—not for novelty's sake, "but as a way of understanding who the Taliban are."
Their journey started June 1 in San Diego and will end about 3,000 miles later in Nutley. Bonora typed in his location and destination on Google and clicked "walking route." One route was changed because it went 80 miles in the desert with nowhere to stop for water.

CPS has declined The Arizona Republic's request seeking records on the workers involved, saying an investigation is ongoing.
Saturday's protests - the most turbulent since Oakland police forcefully dismantled an Occupy encampment in November - came just days after the group announced a new round of actions. The group said it planned to use a vacant building as a social center and political hub and threatened to try to shut down the Port of Oakland for a third time, occupy the airport and take over City Hall.
"There is a worldview war in this country," Becker said in an interview. "There's a battle between people who think religious people are trying to disrupt the integrity of the scientific method and those who know we're not."
This is something that should have been seized upon by the Republican presidential candidates. It had all the elements found in the common GOP narrative about President Barack Obama. How many times have we heard that Obama is obliterating states' rights, shredding the Constitution, abusing his authority to punish political enemies, backing away from campaign promises and misallocating federal resources?
Seven council candidates filed in District 3. Five Democrats are seeking their party's nomination in the primary. The winner will face Republican Patty Gascoyne and Green Party candidate Alan Crossman in November.
Growing marijuana hundreds of feet underground - the same way the company started its Canadian operations in 2001 - provides security, constant temperature, controlled light and humidity, and protects the plants from bugs and diseases, eliminating the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides, Zettl said. He said any medical marijuana sold in Michigan should be subject to the same regular and rigorous testing as is found in Canada.
The art of adaptation, as the rash of movies derived from plays this season attests, is never easy. The best artistic looters of all time — Shakespeare, the Greek tragedians — recognized that independent vision is everything. Borrowing didn't inhibit them in least. Their goal, of course, wasn't to duplicate but to create something autonomous. Heck, Shakespeare wasn't beyond taking a freehand with history itself.
The soiree, co-chaired by Joseph M. Antunovich and 2009 award recipient Richard Driehaus, attracted more than 400 guests, including such notable names as Abbott CEO Miles White, WTTW-Channel 11's resident architecture guru Geoffrey Baer, Ariel Investments' Mellody Hobson and auctioneer Leslie Hindman. Partygoers began the evening with cocktails, followed by dinner and the awards program that annually gives prizes to those who have made long-standing contributions to the civic, corporate and cultural landscape of Chicago.

Gladys Zimmerman said she was concerned about her son's safety in that program because he traveled twice a month to a dangerous neighborhood.
Hanna may have put it best.
The New York-based alliance argues that Perdue shares responsibility with the Hudsons for manure from their chicken houses that allegedly washed off the farm, because the company owns the Cornish game hens raised there. Perdue has argued in court filings that the company's not responsible if any pollution did occur because the farmers are independent contractors.
Fiscally responsible government officials would tell the lawyers how much they can spend up front and then demand they come back and justify what they spent, before giving them more money.
Mount St. Mary’s needed – and got – two wins in its final Northeast Conference games to qualify for the No. 4 seed in the league tournament. And for their troubles, the Mountaineers (5-8 overall and 2-3 in the NEC) will tangle with No. 1 seed Robert Morris (11-3, 5-0) in Friday evening’s semifinal.
Of course, good skyscraper design isn't all about height, and there are growing signs that U.S architecture is moving upward with some confidence. Frank Gehry's fledgling new residential tower in Manhattan's financial district isn't Goliath, but it's 76 stories of optimistic twists and thrusts never seen before. Also rising: Freedom Tower, or 1 WTC, on the old World Trade Center site — a 1,776-foot statement that America will keep on keeping on.
The Pacers showed their team unity -- and maturity -- when they came to the defense of one another during the fourth quarter.
Kucinich, Marilley and Gans agree on that point: To many Democrats, Obama's performance dampened their enthusiasm in the midterm elections. They believed his economic stimulus was not too large but, rather, too small to repair the economy.
“Then what reason would there have been to vote no on this?” Hanson asked, directing his question to Committeewomen Donna Szymborski and Denice DiCarlo. “To put our town in jeopardy? I don’t understand it.”
It’s not that I or anyone else would want to be in the park at 8 a.m. It’s cold, and sometimes the grass is wet.
The eatery sits on Front St., in one of the oldest buildings in the city. Completely restored and revamped by its new tenants, owners Tamer Hamawi, Elise Rosenberg, Emelie Kihlstrom, and Bradford McDonald, the vibe is simple, chic, with a touch of "Day of the Dead." Inspired by Mexican artist Jose Guadalupe Posada (the eatery is named for one of his sketches), the wallpaper boasts sketches of Brooklyn with a dark side: like the Statue of Liberty with the head of a skeleton.
The measure, which was approved by the state Senate on Thursday, now moves to the desk of Gov. Chris Christie, who is expected to sign it tomorrow.
Irving was back in the starting lineup Saturday and finished with 20 points and six assists a day after resting with an illness. He also scored 20 against Utah in January, while Antawn Jamison finished with 22 points and seven rebounds.
South Carolina voters also clearly explained why. Exit polls showed that Mr. Romney's two (and only) messages—that he is the best suited to turn around the economy and to defeat Barack Obama—aren't working for the majority of voters. Mr. Gingrich beat Mr. Romney on both issues. The electorate explained that they first and foremost want a candidate willing to passionately promote conservative ideals.
Toyota President Akio Toyoda, a racing fan, said he always "talks" with his car when he is zipping around on the circuit.
I don't know exactly what Young did. I'd like to say we should not rush to judgment but, hey, I'm not the guy who suspended him a week without pay.
Vander Plaats has said he will decide after the forum whether to endorse in the race, and that endorsement would be considered a prize in the unsettled GOP race.
It's impossible to say how an announced Santorum victory earlier this month might have changed the dynamics in the GOP race. Instead, after Romney won a convincing New Hampshire primary victory Jan. 10, he was able to lay claim to a feat no non-incumbent Republican presidential candidate had ever accomplished: winning both Iowa and New Hampshire.
The company said it plans to send out details on its financial projections next month to unnamed "participants" and invited Simon to remain part of the process.
The 1900s are a cool band from the Midwest with excellent musical ideas. Stevie Jackson is a fan, which makes good sense, or maybe bad sense, since they enjoy ripping off Stevie Jackson. But the lyrics are terrible. Here is a sample chorus for your examination: "I would like to dance/ from Nola to Yahweh/ drinking soda from a paper plate/ Bmore/ Bmore amore." Go on, guys, kick the next one in Esperanto. It can't make less sense.
The release of the papers, at http://www.ctc.usma.edu/, comes as Republicans criticized the Obama reelection campaign for using the killing of bin Laden as a political talking point.
"We now have some very strict issues that are going to have to be addressed before the Postal Service can just summarily, with the stroke of a pen, shut down institutions in communities that are way more important than bricks and mortar," McCaskill, D-Mo., said after the vote.
Many reports are expected to land late Tuesday night, while the political class is busy digesting the results of Florida’s primaries. But the filings by the early birds are already underscoring the close ties between the putatively independent organizations and the candidates they back.

Up on the 4th and 5th floors today, Chief Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Fennelly was showing off a modern for wiretapping, and an evidence room, home to an old Aaron Safe Co. vault and shelving surrounded by a storm fence and monitored by video cameras. "We’re in the unpacking mode," he said. "This is really our first day of business."
The financing had been denied. Steve says Integrity not only refused to offer him alternative financing, but refused to allow him to find any on his own!
The facts are evident: There were 206 people who reported annual taxable incomes of $1 million or more in 1916. But as tax rates rose, that number fell to 21 by 1921. After a series of tax-rate cuts in the 1920s, the number of individuals reporting taxable incomes of $1 million or more rose again to 207 by 1925.
Athletes like Jackie Robinson, Babe Didrikson and Jim Thorpe come to mind, but so does the lesser known Grete Waitz, a high school teacher turned marathon runner who died of cancer this week at age 57. Her domination of the sport of marathon running includes nine wins between 1978 and 1988 at the elite New York City Marathon, a feat no one else has replicated.
He asks new students what their names are, what school they came from, if they knew the social worker there. He tells them if they have any trouble, come see him. The next time he sees them he remembers the name and checks in again.
But the company suspended operations at the three plants in March amid public uproar over the filler. BPI has declined to discuss financial details, but has said it took a "substantial" hit after social media exploded with worry over the product and an online petition seeking its ouster from schools drew hundreds of thousands of supporters.
For just the second time this season, Sullinger was held in single digits, scoring nine points on 4-of-7 shooting before fouling out for the first time this season. His first time under 10 points was when he scored three points in six minutes at South Carolina after hurting his foot.
This place is not what you'd expect to find in the middle -- if not the middle, then within shouting distance of the middle -- of nowhere.
Measuring glucose without breaking the skin has been particularly vexing for scientists, in part because accuracy is crucial. If a patient is given insulin for a false blood sugar reading, the consequences can be life-threatening.
