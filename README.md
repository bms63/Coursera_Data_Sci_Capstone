# Coursera Data Science Capstone

Final Capstone project for [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) through Coursera.  

The Capstone started with the basics of natural language processing by first analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together.  I then moved on to understaning how to clean and analyze text data, and then building and sampling to form a predictive text model.  Three bencmakrs were put in place by Coursera, two Quizzes and a Milesone Report.   Finally, using the knowledge gained to create a data product via a predictive Shiny App and a brief presentations that could be shown to family, friends or potential employers.
